# Hypertube
###### *a web app for the 21st century*

This project involves the creation of a web application that allows the user to research and watch videos. The player is directly integrated to the website and the videos are downloaded using the BitTorrent protocol.

The search engine queries multiple external sources and once a film is selected, it's downloaded from the server and streamed on the web player simultaneously. Which means that the player wonâ€™t play the video only once the download is complete, but will be able to directly stream the video feed.


### Technologies used
* Node.js (with Express)
