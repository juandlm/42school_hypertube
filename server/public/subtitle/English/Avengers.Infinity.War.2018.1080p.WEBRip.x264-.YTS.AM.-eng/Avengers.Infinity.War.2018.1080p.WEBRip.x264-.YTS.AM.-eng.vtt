00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.534
<i>This is the Asgardian</i>

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:30.005
<i>refugee vessel Statesman.</i>

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.009
<i>We are under assault.</i>

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.409
<i>I repeat,
we are under assault.</i>

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.979
<i>The engines are dead,
life support failing.</i>

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.283
<i>Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.</i>

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.287
<i>We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.</i>

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.856
<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:51.591
<i>We have
very few soldiers here.</i>

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.560
<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.564
<i>I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.</i>

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.947
Hear me and rejoice.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.051
You have had the privilege

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:20.789
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.927
You may think
this is suffering.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:28.295
No.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.600
It is salvation.

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.338
Universal scales
tip toward balance

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.942
because of your sacrifice.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.044
Smile.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.513
For even in death,

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.885
you have become
Children of Thanos.

00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:07.468
I know what it's like to lose.

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:12.573
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:15.977
yet to fail, nonetheless.

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:25.753
It's frightening.

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:28.990
Turns the legs to jelly.

00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:33.394
But I ask you, to what end?

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:37.398
Dread it, run from it...

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:40.868
destiny arrives all the same.

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:43.904
And now, it's here.

00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:46.440
Or should I say...

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.343
I am.

00:02:54.648 --> 00:02:55.950
You talk too much.

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.051
The Tesseract.

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:01.355
Or your brother's head.

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:08.395
I assume you have
a preference.

00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:10.896
Oh, I do.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:14.368
Kill away.

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:30.684
All right, stop!

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.455
We don't have the Tesseract.

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:38.092
It was destroyed on Asgard.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.839
You really are
the worst brother.

00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:58.944
I assure you, brother...

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:01.014
the sun will shine
on us again.

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:06.151
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:10.255
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.457
And for another...

00:04:13.827 --> 00:04:15.060
we have a Hulk.

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:29.044
Let him have his fun.

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:22.862
Allfathers...

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:27.967
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:29.902
time.

00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:46.152
That was a mistake.

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:53.793
No!

00:06:02.902 --> 00:06:05.605
You're going to die for that.

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:09.876
Shh.

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.617
My humble personage...

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.188
bows before your grandeur.

00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:29.126
No other being
has ever had the might...

00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:31.162
nay, the nobility...

00:06:31.164 --> 00:06:35.935
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:43.842
The universe lies
within your grasp.

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:25.851
There are two more stones
on Earth.

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.054
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:32.722
Father,
we will not fail you.

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:35.258
If I might interject.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.430
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:42.265
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

00:07:42.267 --> 00:07:44.767
If you consider
failure experience.

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:47.372
I consider
experience experience.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.373
Almighty Thanos...

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:55.113
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.118
Odinson...

00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:05.991
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:08.393
god of mischief...

00:08:09.294 --> 00:08:10.896
do hereby pledge to you...

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.134
my undying fidelity.

00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:28.180
Undying?

00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:35.185
You should choose your words
more carefully.

00:08:56.174 --> 00:08:57.175
You...

00:08:58.276 --> 00:08:59.944
will never be...

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:03.814
a god.

00:09:14.058 --> 00:09:15.059
No!

00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:32.444
No resurrections this time.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:58.269
No. Loki.

00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:40.175
<i>Seriously,
you don't have any money?</i>

00:10:40.177 --> 00:10:43.345
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

00:10:43.347 --> 00:10:44.913
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:46.948
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.950
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

00:10:48.952 --> 00:10:50.085
Dollars?

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:52.021
- Rupees.
- Which is?

00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:53.488
Uh, buck and a half.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.357
What do you want?

00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:57.494
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

00:11:10.074 --> 00:11:12.043
Thanos is coming.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:13.876
He's coming.

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:19.249
Who?

00:11:28.025 --> 00:11:29.391
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:30.559
You're totally rambling.

00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:31.493
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:32.927
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:34.161
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:35.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:36.264
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

00:11:36.266 --> 00:11:37.666
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:38.933
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

00:11:38.935 --> 00:11:40.001
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.135
And then you wake up
and in real life

00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:42.236
you actually have to pee.

00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:43.305
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:11:43.307 --> 00:11:44.539
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.575
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

00:11:46.577 --> 00:11:50.581
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:52.714
It was so real.

00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:54.248
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.383
Uh, what was his name?

00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:57.719
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

00:11:57.721 --> 00:11:59.554
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:01.355
...and thought that we were...

00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:02.524
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

00:12:02.526 --> 00:12:03.391
- Yes?
- No.

00:12:03.393 --> 00:12:05.226
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

00:12:05.228 --> 00:12:07.228
If you wanted to have a kid...

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.296
you wouldn't have done that.

00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:11.332
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:13.001
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:14.402
You're not helping
your case, okay?

00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:15.637
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:17.471
You don't need that.

00:12:17.473 --> 00:12:18.607
I know, I had the surgery.

00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:20.008
I'm just
trying to protect us...

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.643
and future usses
and that's it.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:23.377
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:25.314
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.482
You know me so well.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:31.686
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

00:12:31.688 --> 00:12:33.589
You should have shirts
in your closet.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.757
Yeah.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.658
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.160
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

00:12:39.162 --> 00:12:41.295
Show off this Harry Winston.

00:12:41.297 --> 00:12:43.697
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:45.065
I should promise you.

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:46.302
- Yes.
- I will.

00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:49.770
Thank you.

00:12:49.772 --> 00:12:50.971
Tony Stark.

00:12:50.973 --> 00:12:54.243
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

00:12:56.245 --> 00:12:59.047
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:01.016
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

00:13:01.018 --> 00:13:03.184
We need your help.

00:13:03.186 --> 00:13:04.718
It's not overselling it
to say that

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.520
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:08.057
And who's "we"?

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:11.026
Hey, Tony.

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:12.159
Bruce.

00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:13.663
- Pepper.
- Hi.

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:18.367
- Oh.
- You okay?

00:13:20.203 --> 00:13:22.403
At the dawn
of the universe,

00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:24.373
there was nothing. Then...

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:26.540
Boom.

00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:30.144
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:33.015
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.549
These Infinity Stones

00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:38.488
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:40.590
Space.

00:13:41.691 --> 00:13:43.025
Reality.

00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:45.661
Power.

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:48.163
Soul.

00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:50.399
Mind.

00:13:52.335 --> 00:13:53.536
And Time.

00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:04.478
Tell me his name again.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.779
Thanos.

00:14:05.781 --> 00:14:07.280
He's a plague, Tony.

00:14:07.282 --> 00:14:09.315
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

00:14:09.317 --> 00:14:11.552
He wipes out
half the population.

00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:13.821
He sent Loki.

00:14:13.823 --> 00:14:16.759
The attack on New York,
that's him.

00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:18.527
This is it.

00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:20.628
What's our timeline?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.229
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.163
That already makes him

00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:25.866
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

00:14:25.868 --> 00:14:29.402
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

00:14:29.404 --> 00:14:30.537
He could destroy life

00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:32.706
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.708
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.877
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.513
Is that what it is?

00:14:41.283 --> 00:14:43.218
I'm going to allow that.

00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:46.820
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

00:14:46.822 --> 00:14:48.454
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:49.689
No can do.

00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.492
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:53.760
And I swore off dairy...

00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:56.396
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

00:14:56.398 --> 00:14:57.898
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.532
A bit chalky.

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:01.301
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:02.468
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.570
Point is, things change.

00:15:03.572 --> 00:15:06.673
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

00:15:06.675 --> 00:15:08.841
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:09.742
Yeah, so conversely,

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:11.878
it may also be
his best chance against us.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.513
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:14.581
What is your job exactly?

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:16.284
Besides making
balloon animals.

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:20.153
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:22.689
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

00:15:22.691 --> 00:15:24.657
The fact is
we have this stone.

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:26.392
We know where it is.

00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:28.795
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.565
and we have to find him now.

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:32.799
Yeah, that's the thing.

00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:33.800
What do you mean?

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.336
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:37.503
He's offline.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.838
- What?
- Yeah.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.907
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:43.443
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:44.813
Who could find Vision then?

00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:49.549
Shit.

00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:50.683
Probably Steve Rogers.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:51.820
Oh, great.

00:15:52.387 --> 00:15:53.555
Maybe.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.255
But...

00:15:58.627 --> 00:15:59.728
Call him.

00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:02.829
It's not that easy.

00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:04.797
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:05.865
No.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.602
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.370
Broke up?

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.338
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.275
Cap and I fell out hard.

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.411
We're not on speaking terms.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.382
Tony, listen to me.

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.718
Thor's gone.

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:26.518
Thanos is coming.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.389
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:46.607
Flip phone.

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:08.928
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.264
moving your hair, would ya?

00:17:11.033 --> 00:17:13.465
Not at the moment, no.

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.835
You okay?

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:50.068
- Help him!
- Banner!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.870
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:52.938
Friday, what am I looking at?

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.573
<i>Not sure.
I'm working on it.</i>

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:56.675
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:57.976
in your back pocket, Doc!

00:17:57.978 --> 00:17:59.346
Might wanna use it.

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:29.074
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:30.809
Holy shit.

00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:32.510
We're all gonna die!

00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:33.812
There's a spaceship!

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:35.647
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

00:18:44.025 --> 00:18:45.356
What's the matter
with you kids?

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:46.994
You never seen
a spaceship before?

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:01.739
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:02.874
Notify first responders.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:04.012
<i>Will do.</i>

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.441
Hear me and rejoice.

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.176
You are about to die

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.477
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.048
Be thankful...

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.983
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.919
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.822
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:53.891
Stonekeeper.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:56.427
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.629
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:00.967
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:03.667
He means get lost, Squidward.

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:04.869
He exhausts me.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.971
Bring me the stone.

00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:09.976
Banner, you want a piece?

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.543
Mmm, no, not really.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:13.911
But when do I ever get
what I want?

00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:14.914
That's right.

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.981
Okay. Push!

00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:18.682
It's been a while.

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.217
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.384
Okay. Shh.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:24.221
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.723
Come on, come on, man.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.927
God!

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:30.493
Where's your guy?

00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:33.197
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.565
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.087
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:44.308
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.576
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:47.543
It's okay.

00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:50.080
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.549
- I have him.
- Damn it.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.576
Where'd that come from?

00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:21.644
<i>It's nanotech.</i>

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.046
<i>You like it?
A little something I...</i>

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.818
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.021
won't be joining us...

00:21:39.664 --> 00:21:41.031
<i>Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.</i>

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.532
It stays with me.

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.535
Exactly. Bye.

00:21:53.144 --> 00:21:54.644
Tony, you okay?

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.679
<i>- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.</i>

00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:57.914
<i>Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

00:21:57.916 --> 00:21:59.150
I'm trying. He won't come out.

00:22:01.052 --> 00:22:02.120
<i>Hammer.</i>

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.962
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.198
Come out! Come out! Come out!

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.569
No!

00:22:21.272 --> 00:22:23.108
What do you mean, "no"?

00:22:28.913 --> 00:22:30.747
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:33.585
<i>- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.</i>

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.260
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

00:22:37.922 --> 00:22:38.988
Uh, he's from space.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.224
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.819
Your powers are quaint.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.622
You must be popular
with children.

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.359
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:18.794
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:36.778
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.414
You'll only wish
you were dead.

00:23:48.725 --> 00:23:49.726
No!

00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:55.398
<i>Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.</i>

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.035
On it!

00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:05.876
Not cool.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.081
Gotcha!

00:24:12.249 --> 00:24:13.250
Wait!

00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:24.092
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

00:24:24.094 --> 00:24:25.329
<i>Hang on, kid.</i>

00:24:41.078 --> 00:24:42.379
Oh!

00:24:44.214 --> 00:24:45.280
Ugh.

00:24:45.282 --> 00:24:47.084
<i>Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.</i>

00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:55.925
Give me a little juice,
Friday.

00:25:04.768 --> 00:25:06.168
Unlock 17:A.

00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:20.949
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:23.318
But you said
save the wizard!

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.419
I can't breathe.

00:25:25.422 --> 00:25:27.291
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

00:25:28.258 --> 00:25:30.460
Yeah. That makes sense.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.944
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

00:25:49.946 --> 00:25:50.945
<i>Happy trails, kid.</i>

00:25:50.947 --> 00:25:52.468
<i>- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.</i>

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.917
Oh, come on!

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.393
<i>Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.</i>

00:26:05.395 --> 00:26:06.428
<i>Tony? Oh, my God.</i>

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.495
<i>Are you all right?
What's going on?</i>

00:26:07.497 --> 00:26:08.563
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think</i>

00:26:08.565 --> 00:26:10.398
<i>we might have to push
our 8:30 res.</i>

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.533
<i>Why?</i>

00:26:11.535 --> 00:26:13.200
<i>Just 'cause
I'll probably</i>

00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:15.803
<i>not make it back for a while.</i>

00:26:15.805 --> 00:26:17.071
<i>Tell me
you're not on that ship.</i>

00:26:17.073 --> 00:26:18.340
Yeah.

00:26:18.342 --> 00:26:19.541
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

00:26:19.543 --> 00:26:21.343
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:22.377
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:24.078
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.247
<i>- Pep.
- Come back here right now.</i>

00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:27.281
<i>Come back.</i>

00:26:27.283 --> 00:26:30.050
<i>Boss,
we're losing her.</i>

00:26:30.052 --> 00:26:31.488
<i>I'm going too.</i>

00:26:40.564 --> 00:26:41.964
Oh, my God!

00:26:46.335 --> 00:26:48.304
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:04.318
Where you going?

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.953
The Time Stone's been taken.

00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:07.890
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

00:27:08.391 --> 00:27:09.959
What will you do?

00:27:10.593 --> 00:27:12.328
I'm gonna make a call.

00:27:52.568 --> 00:27:53.902
Sing it, Drax!

00:28:06.382 --> 00:28:08.015
Why are we doing this again?

00:28:08.017 --> 00:28:09.583
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

00:28:09.585 --> 00:28:10.917
Someone could be dying.

00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:13.119
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

00:28:13.121 --> 00:28:15.088
'Cause we're nice.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.155
And maybe whoever it is

00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:18.025
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

00:28:18.027 --> 00:28:20.427
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:22.329
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:23.497
We take his ship.

00:28:23.499 --> 00:28:25.299
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

00:28:25.301 --> 00:28:26.302
All right!

00:28:29.538 --> 00:28:31.438
We are arriving.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.506
All right, Guardians,

00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:33.940
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:36.177
so let's put on
our mean faces.

00:28:41.383 --> 00:28:43.082
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

00:28:43.084 --> 00:28:44.150
I don't wanna tell you again.

00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:45.385
Groot.

00:28:45.387 --> 00:28:46.553
I am Groot!

00:28:46.555 --> 00:28:47.654
- Whoa!
- Language!

00:28:47.656 --> 00:28:49.255
- Hey!
- Wow.

00:28:49.257 --> 00:28:51.124
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

00:28:51.126 --> 00:28:52.626
Ever since
you got a little sap,

00:28:52.628 --> 00:28:54.595
you're a total d-hole.

00:28:54.597 --> 00:28:57.999
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.374
What happened?

00:29:10.412 --> 00:29:11.680
Oh, my God.

00:29:17.352 --> 00:29:19.154
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

00:29:21.356 --> 00:29:23.456
Wipers! Wipers!

00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:24.692
Get it off.

00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:34.367
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:36.335
He is not a dude.

00:29:36.337 --> 00:29:38.237
You're a dude.

00:29:38.239 --> 00:29:41.574
This... This is a man.

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:44.510
A handsome, muscular man.

00:29:44.512 --> 00:29:45.578
I'm muscular.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.646
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

00:29:46.648 --> 00:29:48.214
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:49.215
Yeah, right.

00:29:49.217 --> 00:29:50.750
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

00:29:50.752 --> 00:29:51.952
What?

00:29:54.189 --> 00:29:56.057
Gamora, do you think I'm...

00:29:58.293 --> 00:30:02.094
He is anxious, angry.

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:05.698
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.568
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.535
Wow.

00:30:09.537 --> 00:30:11.737
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:14.640
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

00:30:14.642 --> 00:30:15.708
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.343
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

00:30:17.345 --> 00:30:18.578
It's like his muscles

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.646
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

00:30:20.648 --> 00:30:22.417
Stop massaging his muscles.

00:30:24.252 --> 00:30:25.253
Wake him up.

00:30:28.323 --> 00:30:29.589
Wake.

00:30:46.808 --> 00:30:49.209
Who the hell are you guys?

00:30:51.846 --> 00:30:55.681
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

00:30:55.683 --> 00:30:57.517
To bring balance
to the universe

00:30:57.519 --> 00:31:00.586
by wiping out
half of all life.

00:31:00.588 --> 00:31:02.822
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

00:31:02.824 --> 00:31:04.556
massacre by massacre.

00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:06.191
Including my own.

00:31:06.193 --> 00:31:07.793
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

00:31:07.795 --> 00:31:11.162
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

00:31:11.164 --> 00:31:13.766
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:17.604
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

00:31:21.642 --> 00:31:23.710
Your father killed my brother.

00:31:24.177 --> 00:31:25.477
Oh, boy.

00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:27.345
Stepfather, technically.

00:31:27.347 --> 00:31:29.283
And she hates him
as much as you do.

00:31:32.854 --> 00:31:34.619
Families can be tough.

00:31:34.621 --> 00:31:36.154
Before my father died,

00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:37.890
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

00:31:37.892 --> 00:31:40.425
that he imprisoned in Hel.

00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:43.528
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.897
So I had to kill her.

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:47.198
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.402
Goes round and round and...

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:50.402
I feel your pain.

00:31:50.404 --> 00:31:52.771
I feel your pain as well,
because...

00:31:52.773 --> 00:31:54.172
I mean,
it's not a competition,

00:31:54.174 --> 00:31:55.407
but I've been through a lot.

00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:57.275
My father killed my mother.

00:31:57.277 --> 00:31:58.443
And then I had to kill
my father.

00:31:58.445 --> 00:32:00.178
That was hard.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.515
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

00:32:03.517 --> 00:32:06.551
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

00:32:06.553 --> 00:32:08.322
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.692
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

00:32:13.694 --> 00:32:16.394
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:19.764
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

00:32:21.268 --> 00:32:22.469
No, you're not.

00:32:24.404 --> 00:32:28.707
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:32.211
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

00:32:33.947 --> 00:32:35.780
- No.
- You are.

00:32:35.782 --> 00:32:38.683
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

00:32:38.685 --> 00:32:40.184
No, I'm not.

00:32:40.186 --> 00:32:42.188
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

00:32:48.327 --> 00:32:49.694
Are you mocking me?

00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:53.230
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:54.298
He's trying to copy me.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.432
I need you to stop doing that.

00:32:55.434 --> 00:32:57.267
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:58.703
We need to stop Thanos.

00:32:58.705 --> 00:33:00.404
Which means
we need to find out

00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:01.539
where he's going next.

00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:02.874
Knowhere.

00:33:02.876 --> 00:33:04.743
He must be going somewhere.

00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:06.878
No, no. Knowhere?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.748
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.617
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:15.887
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:17.354
Because for years...

00:33:17.356 --> 00:33:19.556
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

00:33:19.558 --> 00:33:21.225
with a man
called the Collector.

00:33:21.227 --> 00:33:22.827
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:24.729
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

00:33:24.731 --> 00:33:26.363
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

00:33:26.365 --> 00:33:28.933
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:31.568
There are six stones
out there.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.872
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

00:33:33.874 --> 00:33:37.675
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

00:33:37.677 --> 00:33:39.844
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

00:33:39.846 --> 00:33:42.713
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

00:33:42.715 --> 00:33:44.481
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

00:33:44.483 --> 00:33:45.749
They're with the Avengers.

00:33:45.751 --> 00:33:48.285
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

00:33:48.287 --> 00:33:49.520
Like Kevin Bacon?

00:33:49.522 --> 00:33:50.821
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

00:33:50.823 --> 00:33:51.889
I haven't been there
in a while.

00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:54.458
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.293
No one even knows where it is.

00:33:56.295 --> 00:33:57.962
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

00:33:57.964 --> 00:33:59.663
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

00:33:59.665 --> 00:34:02.332
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

00:34:02.334 --> 00:34:03.500
You're welcome.

00:34:03.502 --> 00:34:04.802
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:08.906
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

00:34:08.908 --> 00:34:10.908
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:14.311
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:15.946
That place is a legend.

00:34:15.948 --> 00:34:17.548
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.717
to ever torment the universe.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.885
I would very much like
to go there, please.

00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:22.953
The rabbit is correct

00:34:22.955 --> 00:34:24.054
and clearly the smartest
among you.

00:34:24.056 --> 00:34:25.089
Rabbit?

00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:27.758
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.059
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:30.394
You're very perceptive.

00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:31.628
You seem like a noble leader.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.430
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

00:34:33.432 --> 00:34:36.400
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

00:34:36.402 --> 00:34:38.335
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

00:34:38.337 --> 00:34:39.503
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:40.704
Quiet.

00:34:40.706 --> 00:34:42.372
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

00:34:42.374 --> 00:34:44.008
Look, this is my ship.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.810
And I'm not goin' to...

00:34:46.812 --> 00:34:49.013
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

00:34:49.015 --> 00:34:51.081
The Thanos-killing kind.

00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:52.816
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

00:34:52.818 --> 00:34:54.985
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

00:34:54.987 --> 00:34:56.319
Your bodies would crumble

00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:57.588
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.656
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

00:34:59.658 --> 00:35:00.924
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

00:35:00.926 --> 00:35:02.391
If we don't go to Knowhere

00:35:02.393 --> 00:35:03.994
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:05.763
he'll be too powerful to stop.

00:35:05.765 --> 00:35:08.032
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

00:35:08.034 --> 00:35:09.867
We got two ships

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:11.501
and a large assortment
of morons.

00:35:11.503 --> 00:35:14.838
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.040
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

00:35:16.042 --> 00:35:17.841
to try to stop Thanos.

00:35:17.843 --> 00:35:19.910
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

00:35:19.912 --> 00:35:21.945
For the record...

00:35:21.947 --> 00:35:23.479
I know that
you're going with him

00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:24.681
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

00:35:24.683 --> 00:35:26.349
You know, you really shouldn't

00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:28.453
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.121
Come on, Groot.

00:35:31.123 --> 00:35:33.957
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

00:35:37.662 --> 00:35:40.663
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

00:35:40.665 --> 00:35:41.766
Bye.

00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:58.049
Vis?

00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.117
Is it the stone again?

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:01.820
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.023
What does it say?

00:36:05.025 --> 00:36:07.492
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.862
Hey.

00:36:20.738 --> 00:36:23.341
Tell me what you feel.

00:36:30.148 --> 00:36:32.917
I just feel you.

00:36:41.059 --> 00:36:43.125
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

00:36:43.127 --> 00:36:45.461
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

00:36:45.463 --> 00:36:46.963
What if
I miss that train?

00:36:46.965 --> 00:36:48.097
There's an 11:00.

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:50.635
What if I missed
all the trains?

00:36:51.936 --> 00:36:53.836
What if this time
I didn't go back?

00:36:53.838 --> 00:36:55.438
But you gave Stark your word.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.606
I'd rather give it to you.

00:36:56.608 --> 00:36:58.808
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.209
We both made promises.

00:37:00.211 --> 00:37:01.980
Not to each other.

00:37:02.513 --> 00:37:04.480
Wanda.

00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:06.883
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:09.051
trying to see
if this could work and...

00:37:09.053 --> 00:37:10.853
I don't know.

00:37:10.855 --> 00:37:12.889
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:14.857
I think...

00:37:14.859 --> 00:37:16.058
- It works.
- It works.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.494
It works.

00:37:19.864 --> 00:37:21.065
Stay.

00:37:22.001 --> 00:37:23.735
Stay with me.

00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:31.743
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

00:37:38.783 --> 00:37:40.850
What are they?

00:37:40.852 --> 00:37:43.187
What the stone
was warning me about.

00:37:53.164 --> 00:37:54.696
I have to go.

00:37:54.698 --> 00:37:56.198
No, Vision.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.666
Vision, if that's true,

00:37:57.668 --> 00:38:00.504
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

00:38:01.538 --> 00:38:02.737
Wanda, I...

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:04.775
Vision!

00:38:32.903 --> 00:38:36.571
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

00:38:36.573 --> 00:38:38.574
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.110
My systems are failing.

00:38:42.112 --> 00:38:44.848
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

00:38:47.285 --> 00:38:48.485
Vis!

00:38:57.561 --> 00:39:00.929
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:40.137
Hands off.

00:39:55.986 --> 00:39:57.318
Come on. Come on.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.287
Come on, you gotta get up.

00:39:59.289 --> 00:40:01.657
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:04.359
Hey. We have to go.

00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:08.762
Please. Please leave.

00:40:08.764 --> 00:40:10.599
You asked me to stay.

00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:12.935
- I'm staying.
- Please.

00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:26.007
- Get up.
- I can't.

00:41:26.009 --> 00:41:28.909
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:31.047
You'll never get
the chance again.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.929
Can you stand?

00:41:53.269 --> 00:41:54.803
Thank you, Captain.

00:41:57.373 --> 00:41:59.074
Let's get you on the jet.

00:42:03.046 --> 00:42:06.513
Now, I thought we had a deal.

00:42:06.515 --> 00:42:10.417
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:12.020
I'm sorry.

00:42:12.022 --> 00:42:13.855
We just wanted time.

00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:17.825
Where to, Cap?

00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:22.097
Home.

00:42:25.767 --> 00:42:27.867
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:53.427
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

00:42:53.429 --> 00:42:55.362
Mother! Where's my mother?

00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:56.963
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

00:42:56.965 --> 00:42:58.465
Mother!

00:42:58.467 --> 00:43:00.933
<i>One side
is a revelation...</i>

00:43:00.935 --> 00:43:03.972
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:06.973
What's wrong, little one?

00:43:06.975 --> 00:43:10.311
My mother. Where is my mother?

00:43:15.149 --> 00:43:16.317
What's your name?

00:43:17.586 --> 00:43:19.919
Gamora.

00:43:19.921 --> 00:43:22.024
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

00:43:23.458 --> 00:43:24.957
Come.

00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:25.960
Let me help you.

00:43:39.374 --> 00:43:40.475
Look.

00:43:44.212 --> 00:43:46.545
Pretty, isn't it?

00:43:46.547 --> 00:43:50.249
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

00:43:50.251 --> 00:43:54.055
Too much to one side
or the other...

00:43:58.059 --> 00:44:00.928
Here. You try.

00:44:04.532 --> 00:44:07.801
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

00:44:09.203 --> 00:44:11.072
Uh-uh.

00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:14.507
Concentrate.

00:44:17.412 --> 00:44:20.248
There. You've got it.

00:44:29.657 --> 00:44:30.924
Gamora.

00:44:31.992 --> 00:44:33.059
Do you know if these grenades

00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:35.394
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

00:44:35.396 --> 00:44:36.529
Because I was thinking about

00:44:36.531 --> 00:44:38.264
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

00:44:38.266 --> 00:44:39.398
But I don't want to
if they're the...

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.601
I need to ask a favor.

00:44:41.536 --> 00:44:43.004
Yeah, sure.

00:44:44.439 --> 00:44:45.571
One way or another,

00:44:45.573 --> 00:44:47.974
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

00:44:49.577 --> 00:44:52.110
Which is what
the grenades are for.

00:44:52.112 --> 00:44:54.382
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

00:44:56.651 --> 00:44:57.851
If things go wrong...

00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:01.456
If Thanos gets me...

00:45:06.093 --> 00:45:08.061
I want you to promise me...

00:45:09.096 --> 00:45:10.197
you'll kill me.

00:45:10.997 --> 00:45:11.998
What?

00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:17.438
I know something he doesn't.

00:45:20.073 --> 00:45:22.307
And if he finds it out,

00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:23.749
the entire universe
could be at risk.

00:45:24.344 --> 00:45:25.544
What do you know?

00:45:25.546 --> 00:45:27.582
If I tell you, you'd know too.

00:45:30.618 --> 00:45:32.551
If it's so important...

00:45:32.553 --> 00:45:33.719
shouldn't I?

00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:34.886
Only if you wanna die.

00:45:34.888 --> 00:45:37.008
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

00:45:38.225 --> 00:45:39.226
Just...

00:45:41.561 --> 00:45:44.697
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

00:45:44.699 --> 00:45:47.298
I mean, I'd like to.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.300
I really would. But you...

00:45:49.302 --> 00:45:50.470
Swear to me.

00:45:54.074 --> 00:45:56.309
Swear to me on your mother.

00:46:03.316 --> 00:46:04.317
Okay.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.491
Okay.

00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:28.773
- Oh.
- Dude.

00:46:28.775 --> 00:46:30.475
How long have you been
standing there?

00:46:30.477 --> 00:46:31.478
An hour.

00:46:32.112 --> 00:46:33.313
An hour?

00:46:33.747 --> 00:46:35.313
Are you serious?

00:46:35.315 --> 00:46:37.515
I've mastered the ability

00:46:37.517 --> 00:46:40.253
of standing
so incredibly still...

00:46:41.421 --> 00:46:44.090
that I become
invisible to the eye.

00:46:44.591 --> 00:46:45.592
Watch.

00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:51.563
You're eating a zarg-nut.

00:46:51.565 --> 00:46:53.098
But my movement...

00:46:53.767 --> 00:46:55.469
was so slow...

00:46:56.336 --> 00:46:58.336
that it's imperceptible.

00:46:58.338 --> 00:46:59.204
Mmm, no.

00:46:59.206 --> 00:47:01.806
I'm sure I'm invisible.

00:47:01.808 --> 00:47:03.142
Hi, Drax.

00:47:05.712 --> 00:47:06.713
Damn it.

00:47:26.633 --> 00:47:28.566
This place looks deserted.

00:47:28.568 --> 00:47:31.503
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

00:47:31.505 --> 00:47:33.439
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

00:47:34.774 --> 00:47:36.342
Let's put down right here.

00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:49.589
I don't have it.

00:47:51.691 --> 00:47:53.524
Everyone
in the galaxy knows

00:47:53.526 --> 00:47:55.192
you'd sell your own brother...

00:47:55.194 --> 00:47:56.828
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.765
to your pathetic collection.

00:48:06.605 --> 00:48:10.107
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:13.479
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

00:48:16.682 --> 00:48:18.350
I told you.

00:48:19.184 --> 00:48:20.185
I sold it.

00:48:22.889 --> 00:48:25.222
Why would I lie?

00:48:25.224 --> 00:48:27.393
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.160
Like suicide.

00:48:30.162 --> 00:48:32.529
You do understand.

00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.666
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

00:48:35.668 --> 00:48:37.467
I didn't know what it was.

00:48:37.469 --> 00:48:40.437
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:41.572
It's him.

00:48:41.574 --> 00:48:43.206
Last chance,
charlatan.

00:48:44.577 --> 00:48:46.677
Where's the stone?

00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:48.211
Today...

00:48:48.213 --> 00:48:49.313
Drax. Drax.

00:48:49.315 --> 00:48:51.381
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

00:48:51.383 --> 00:48:52.418
Drax, wait.

00:48:53.819 --> 00:48:55.452
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.655
Drax.

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.893
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

00:49:02.895 --> 00:49:05.429
He doesn't have the stone yet.

00:49:05.431 --> 00:49:07.798
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.268
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.469
No.

00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:15.872
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

00:49:15.874 --> 00:49:17.309
Sleep.

00:49:29.253 --> 00:49:30.386
Okay.

00:49:30.388 --> 00:49:34.460
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

00:49:35.761 --> 00:49:37.161
The other right.

00:50:01.419 --> 00:50:03.187
Why?

00:50:12.998 --> 00:50:17.235
Why you, daughter?

00:50:35.753 --> 00:50:36.754
That was quick.

00:50:42.593 --> 00:50:47.498
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

00:50:49.767 --> 00:50:52.537
<i>Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?</i>

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.242
<i>In my heart,
I knew you still cared.</i>

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:08.753
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

00:51:17.929 --> 00:51:20.798
<i>Reality is often
disappointing.</i>

00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:26.337
That is, it was.

00:51:28.372 --> 00:51:29.674
Now...

00:51:31.676 --> 00:51:34.512
reality can be
whatever I want.

00:51:35.947 --> 00:51:37.646
You knew I'd come.

00:51:37.648 --> 00:51:39.982
I counted on it.

00:51:39.984 --> 00:51:42.920
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:49.392
Thanos!

00:51:56.868 --> 00:51:57.902
No!

00:52:02.405 --> 00:52:04.439
Let her go, Grimace.

00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:05.442
Peter.

00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:08.013
I told you to go right.

00:52:08.679 --> 00:52:10.112
Now? Really?

00:52:10.114 --> 00:52:11.981
You let her go!

00:52:11.983 --> 00:52:13.883
Ah, the boyfriend.

00:52:13.885 --> 00:52:15.018
No.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.417
Like to think of myself

00:52:16.419 --> 00:52:18.921
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

00:52:18.923 --> 00:52:21.090
- Let her go.
- Peter.

00:52:21.092 --> 00:52:25.863
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:27.932
Not him.

00:52:38.508 --> 00:52:42.079
You promised. You promised.

00:52:46.416 --> 00:52:47.949
Oh, daughter.

00:52:47.951 --> 00:52:50.554
You expect too much from him.

00:52:54.026 --> 00:52:55.692
She's asked, hasn't she?

00:52:59.663 --> 00:53:00.664
Do it.

00:53:04.534 --> 00:53:05.735
Mmm.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.471
Do it!

00:53:15.078 --> 00:53:16.613
I told you to go right.

00:53:18.582 --> 00:53:21.551
I love you more than anything.

00:53:24.654 --> 00:53:26.056
I love you too.

00:53:40.503 --> 00:53:41.538
I like him.

00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:14.168
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:17.571
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

00:54:17.573 --> 00:54:18.806
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

00:54:18.808 --> 00:54:20.875
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

00:54:20.877 --> 00:54:22.609
You know they're
only criminals because

00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:24.145
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

00:54:24.147 --> 00:54:25.280
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

00:54:25.282 --> 00:54:28.883
<i>Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.</i>

00:54:28.885 --> 00:54:30.051
If it weren't
for those Accords,

00:54:30.053 --> 00:54:32.153
Vision would've been
right here.

00:54:32.155 --> 00:54:35.524
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

00:54:35.926 --> 00:54:36.926
That's right.

00:54:38.929 --> 00:54:40.929
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

00:54:40.931 --> 00:54:42.230
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

00:54:42.232 --> 00:54:44.001
Not anymore.

00:54:49.872 --> 00:54:51.540
Mr. Secretary.

00:54:55.978 --> 00:54:57.713
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

00:54:58.248 --> 00:55:00.081
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:01.884
You could use
some of that right now.

00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:05.786
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

00:55:05.788 --> 00:55:09.523
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:11.292
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

00:55:11.294 --> 00:55:13.595
And I'm way past
asking permission.

00:55:15.564 --> 00:55:17.998
Earth just lost
her best defender.

00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:19.168
So we're here to fight.

00:55:20.836 --> 00:55:22.771
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

00:55:23.772 --> 00:55:25.708
we'll fight you too.

00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:29.912
<i>Arrest them.</i>

00:55:31.014 --> 00:55:32.681
All over it.

00:55:37.753 --> 00:55:39.054
That's a court-martial.

00:55:41.623 --> 00:55:42.703
It's great to see you, Cap.

00:55:43.726 --> 00:55:45.592
You too, Rhodey.

00:55:45.594 --> 00:55:46.595
Hey.

00:55:47.863 --> 00:55:50.099
Wow. You guys...

00:55:50.966 --> 00:55:53.100
really look like crap.

00:55:53.102 --> 00:55:54.901
Must've been
a rough couple years.

00:55:54.903 --> 00:55:58.006
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

00:55:58.008 --> 00:56:00.142
Uh, I think
you look great.

00:56:03.612 --> 00:56:04.680
Uh...

00:56:07.216 --> 00:56:09.251
Yeah, I'm back.

00:56:10.986 --> 00:56:11.987
Hi, Bruce.

00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:18.626
Nat.

00:56:21.964 --> 00:56:23.598
This is awkward.

00:56:26.002 --> 00:56:27.768
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.037
And they can clearly find us.

00:56:29.039 --> 00:56:31.637
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:33.106
After the whole
Accords situation,

00:56:33.108 --> 00:56:34.841
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

00:56:34.843 --> 00:56:36.376
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

00:56:36.378 --> 00:56:37.944
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

00:56:37.946 --> 00:56:39.347
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

00:56:40.249 --> 00:56:41.281
Okay, look.

00:56:41.283 --> 00:56:44.351
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

00:56:44.353 --> 00:56:47.890
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

00:56:49.757 --> 00:56:50.924
Vision's stone.

00:56:50.926 --> 00:56:52.259
Then we have to protect it.

00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:53.962
No, we have to destroy it.

00:56:56.098 --> 00:56:57.397
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

00:56:57.399 --> 00:56:58.731
to this entity in my head.

00:56:58.733 --> 00:57:00.766
About its nature.

00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:03.037
But also its composition.

00:57:03.039 --> 00:57:05.105
I think if it were exposed

00:57:05.107 --> 00:57:07.107
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:10.978
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

00:57:12.647 --> 00:57:15.215
its molecular integrity
could fail.

00:57:15.217 --> 00:57:17.983
Yeah, and you with it.

00:57:17.985 --> 00:57:19.685
We're not having
this conversation.

00:57:19.687 --> 00:57:21.754
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

00:57:21.756 --> 00:57:24.191
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

00:57:24.193 --> 00:57:26.361
That's too high a price.

00:57:30.965 --> 00:57:33.268
Only you have
the power to pay it.

00:57:37.672 --> 00:57:39.839
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

00:57:39.841 --> 00:57:42.409
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

00:57:42.411 --> 00:57:43.945
But it should.

00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:47.980
We don't trade lives, Vision.

00:57:47.982 --> 00:57:50.082
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

00:57:50.084 --> 00:57:52.051
to save how many
millions of people?

00:57:52.053 --> 00:57:54.220
Tell me,
why is this any different?

00:57:54.222 --> 00:57:56.657
Because you might
have a choice.

00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:59.225
Your mind is made up

00:57:59.227 --> 00:58:01.861
of a complex construct
of overlays.

00:58:01.863 --> 00:58:05.464
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

00:58:05.466 --> 00:58:07.333
All of them mixed together,

00:58:07.335 --> 00:58:09.235
all of them
learning from one another.

00:58:09.237 --> 00:58:11.170
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

00:58:11.172 --> 00:58:14.373
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:15.975
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

00:58:15.977 --> 00:58:17.810
Perhaps the best parts.

00:58:17.812 --> 00:58:19.080
Can we do that?

00:58:19.847 --> 00:58:21.881
Not me, not here.

00:58:21.883 --> 00:58:23.382
Well,
you better find someone

00:58:23.384 --> 00:58:24.850
and somewhere fast.

00:58:24.852 --> 00:58:26.218
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.388
have your old rooms back.

00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:32.093
I know somewhere.

00:58:46.806 --> 00:58:48.073
The Kingsguard

00:58:48.075 --> 00:58:49.441
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:51.443
And the Border Tribe?

00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:53.345
Those that are left.

00:58:53.347 --> 00:58:55.780
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:57.916
M'Baku likes a good fight.

00:59:00.087 --> 00:59:02.354
And what of this one?

00:59:02.356 --> 00:59:04.923
This one may be tired of war.

00:59:04.925 --> 00:59:07.961
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:32.152
Where's the fight?

00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:34.422
On its way.

00:59:52.939 --> 00:59:55.409
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:59.312
I have never failed him.

01:00:04.384 --> 01:00:07.586
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

01:00:07.588 --> 01:00:09.320
with the Time Stone
still attached

01:00:09.322 --> 01:00:11.590
to your vaguely
irritating person...

01:00:11.592 --> 01:00:14.261
there would be judgment.

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:24.371
Give me...

01:00:28.241 --> 01:00:29.242
the stone.

01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:43.187
Wow, you're a seriously

01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:44.389
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.058
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.426
What the...

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:50.128
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.162
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:00:51.164 --> 01:00:52.597
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:53.498
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.565
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.135
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

01:00:57.137 --> 01:00:58.269
God damn it.

01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:01.239
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:02.640
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:04.208
And now, I'm here in space.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.877
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

01:01:06.879 --> 01:01:09.080
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.214
This is a one-way ticket.

01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:12.050
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

01:01:12.052 --> 01:01:13.151
No, I did think this through.

01:01:13.153 --> 01:01:14.951
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

01:01:14.953 --> 01:01:16.487
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

01:01:16.489 --> 01:01:18.158
if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:21.459
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:22.928
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:28.932
Come on. We got a situation.

01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:30.001
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:31.068
What's your plan?

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.205
- Go.
- Um...

01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:34.505
Okay, okay... Uh...

01:01:34.507 --> 01:01:37.941
<i>Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?</i>

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.349
Painful, aren't they?

01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:48.051
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

01:01:48.053 --> 01:01:50.122
And any one of them...

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:58.029
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

01:01:58.031 --> 01:01:59.664
<i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:02.402
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

01:02:04.236 --> 01:02:06.937
You've saved nothing.

01:02:06.939 --> 01:02:09.006
Your powers
are inconsequential

01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:10.508
compared to mine.

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:12.211
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

01:02:26.358 --> 01:02:28.494
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:45.978
Hey,
we haven't officially met.

01:02:47.212 --> 01:02:48.280
Cool.

01:02:50.282 --> 01:02:51.748
We gotta turn
this ship around.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.117
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:55.552
No, I want to protect
the stone.

01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:56.987
And I want you
to thank me.

01:02:56.989 --> 01:02:58.522
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:01.425
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

01:03:01.427 --> 01:03:03.760
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

01:03:03.762 --> 01:03:04.628
I seriously don't know

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:05.796
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

01:03:05.798 --> 01:03:08.632
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

01:03:08.634 --> 01:03:10.367
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.436
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:14.171
And due to that fact,

01:03:14.173 --> 01:03:15.572
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:17.441
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

01:03:17.443 --> 01:03:19.509
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

01:03:19.511 --> 01:03:20.577
The adults are talking.

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:23.447
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:25.282
What is he, your ward?

01:03:25.284 --> 01:03:26.683
No.

01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:28.718
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.489
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:33.590
I'm Spider-Man, then.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:35.258
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.393
Thing's on autopilot.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.295
Can we control it?

01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:40.232
Fly us home?

01:03:43.235 --> 01:03:44.367
- Stark?
- Yeah.

01:03:44.369 --> 01:03:45.702
Can you get us home?

01:03:45.704 --> 01:03:47.104
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.709
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

01:03:51.443 --> 01:03:53.108
Under no circumstances

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:55.679
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:57.079
I don't think
you quite understand

01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:58.014
what's at stake here.

01:03:58.016 --> 01:04:00.617
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:03.553
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:05.287
Since he sent an army
to New York

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:07.056
and now he's back.

01:04:07.058 --> 01:04:09.124
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:09.126 --> 01:04:10.259
So I'm not so sure

01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:12.294
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:16.131
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

01:04:16.133 --> 01:04:18.434
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

01:04:18.436 --> 01:04:21.370
So I say we take
the fight to him.

01:04:21.372 --> 01:04:22.373
Doctor.

01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:25.677
Do you concur?

01:04:28.246 --> 01:04:30.716
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

01:04:31.783 --> 01:04:34.149
But you have to understand...

01:04:34.151 --> 01:04:35.752
if it comes to saving you

01:04:35.754 --> 01:04:38.454
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

01:04:38.456 --> 01:04:42.191
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

01:04:42.193 --> 01:04:46.395
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

01:04:46.397 --> 01:04:49.300
Nice. Good, moral compass.

01:04:50.535 --> 01:04:52.136
We're straight.

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.639
All right, kid.

01:04:55.874 --> 01:04:57.108
You're an Avenger now.

01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:35.813
I thought
you might be hungry.

01:05:47.925 --> 01:05:49.725
I always hated that chair.

01:05:49.727 --> 01:05:52.494
So I've been told.

01:05:52.496 --> 01:05:56.434
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

01:05:57.233 --> 01:05:58.669
I hated this room.

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:00.936
This ship.

01:06:00.938 --> 01:06:02.773
I hated my life.

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:09.513
You told me that too.

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:14.150
Every day.

01:06:16.787 --> 01:06:18.756
For almost 20 years.

01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:23.728
I was a child
when you took me.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:25.896
I saved you.

01:06:29.499 --> 01:06:30.499
No.

01:06:31.902 --> 01:06:35.671
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

01:06:35.673 --> 01:06:37.405
Going to bed hungry...

01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:39.307
scrounging for scraps.

01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:42.276
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

01:06:42.278 --> 01:06:44.713
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:44.715 --> 01:06:46.715
Do you know
what's happened since then?

01:06:46.717 --> 01:06:48.917
The children born...

01:06:48.919 --> 01:06:52.553
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

01:06:52.555 --> 01:06:53.758
It's a paradise.

01:06:56.493 --> 01:06:58.526
Because you murdered
half the planet.

01:06:58.528 --> 01:07:01.562
A small price to pay
for salvation.

01:07:01.564 --> 01:07:02.697
You're insane.

01:07:02.699 --> 01:07:04.799
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

01:07:04.801 --> 01:07:08.269
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

01:07:08.271 --> 01:07:12.607
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

01:07:12.609 --> 01:07:13.808
It needs correction.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.311
You don't know that!

01:07:16.746 --> 01:07:19.614
I'm the only one
who knows that.

01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:23.787
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

01:07:25.455 --> 01:07:26.456
For a time...

01:07:28.925 --> 01:07:33.329
you had that same will...

01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:37.333
as you fought by my side.

01:07:38.035 --> 01:07:39.269
Daughter.

01:07:39.903 --> 01:07:41.738
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:44.274 --> 01:07:46.876
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:49.310
And, in doing so,

01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:51.514
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

01:07:54.451 --> 01:07:57.320
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:03.491
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:07.294
I am disappointed.

01:08:07.296 --> 01:08:09.666
But not because
you didn't find it.

01:08:13.436 --> 01:08:14.938
But because you did.

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:18.307
And you lied.

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.492
Nebula.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.099
Don't do this.

01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:46.533
Some time ago,

01:08:46.535 --> 01:08:49.436
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

01:08:49.438 --> 01:08:50.504
Please don't do this.

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:52.742
And very nearly succeeded.

01:08:53.475 --> 01:08:54.844
So I brought her here.

01:08:56.478 --> 01:08:57.679
To talk.

01:09:05.387 --> 01:09:07.723
Stop. Stop it.

01:09:13.629 --> 01:09:16.496
I swear to you on my life.

01:09:16.498 --> 01:09:18.734
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:22.838 --> 01:09:24.638
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.041
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

01:09:26.043 --> 01:09:28.842
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:30.045
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

01:09:30.047 --> 01:09:31.112
<i>He will!</i>

01:09:31.114 --> 01:09:33.413
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

01:09:33.415 --> 01:09:35.816
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

01:09:35.818 --> 01:09:38.654
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

01:09:43.692 --> 01:09:45.527
You're strong.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:48.564
Me.

01:09:51.034 --> 01:09:52.701
You're generous.

01:09:53.969 --> 01:09:54.970
Me.

01:09:56.972 --> 01:09:59.639
But I never taught you to lie.

01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:02.344
That's why
you're so bad at it.

01:10:04.513 --> 01:10:08.951
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:10:26.468 --> 01:10:27.469
Vormir!

01:10:45.587 --> 01:10:47.055
The stone is on Vormir.

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:52.861
Show me.

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:56.129
I am Groot.

01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:57.496
Tinkle in the cup.

01:10:57.498 --> 01:10:58.899
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

01:10:58.901 --> 01:11:01.167
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:02.568
I am Groot.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.669
Tree, pour what's in the cup

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:05.504
out into space
and go in the cup again.

01:11:05.506 --> 01:11:06.605
You speak Groot?

01:11:06.607 --> 01:11:08.775
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

01:11:08.777 --> 01:11:09.943
I am Groot.

01:11:09.945 --> 01:11:12.078
You'll know when we're close.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.813
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

01:11:13.815 --> 01:11:15.984
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

01:11:18.854 --> 01:11:20.855
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

01:11:21.622 --> 01:11:23.424
It's truly awesome.

01:11:29.264 --> 01:11:32.566
Okay, time to be the captain.

01:11:37.571 --> 01:11:39.738
So, dead brother, huh?

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.008
Yeah, that could be annoying.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:43.911
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.281
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

01:11:48.283 --> 01:11:50.883
And you said
your sister and your dad?

01:11:50.885 --> 01:11:52.818
Both dead.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.954
But still got a mom, though?

01:11:54.956 --> 01:11:56.289
Killed by a dark elf.

01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:57.589
A best friend?

01:11:57.591 --> 01:11:58.859
Stabbed through the heart.

01:12:02.163 --> 01:12:05.499
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

01:12:07.702 --> 01:12:09.201
Absolutely.

01:12:09.203 --> 01:12:12.938
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.673
they're all
tremendous motivators.

01:12:14.675 --> 01:12:15.808
They really clear the mind.

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:18.044
So I'm good to go.

01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:20.746
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

01:12:20.748 --> 01:12:23.115
he's the toughest there is.

01:12:23.117 --> 01:12:25.284
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

01:12:25.286 --> 01:12:27.619
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:27.621 --> 01:12:29.555
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:31.759
It better be some hammer.

01:12:35.863 --> 01:12:38.897
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

01:12:38.899 --> 01:12:41.066
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

01:12:41.068 --> 01:12:43.102
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

01:12:43.104 --> 01:12:44.837
but none succeeded.

01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:47.906
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

01:12:47.908 --> 01:12:50.876
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

01:12:50.878 --> 01:12:52.911
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

01:12:52.913 --> 01:12:54.813
Fate wills it so.

01:12:54.815 --> 01:12:56.148
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:58.020
And what if you're wrong?

01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:03.090
If I'm wrong, then...

01:13:04.325 --> 01:13:05.960
what more could I lose?

01:13:19.807 --> 01:13:21.173
I could lose a lot.

01:13:21.175 --> 01:13:23.277
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

01:13:27.114 --> 01:13:28.115
Okay.

01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:33.385
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

01:13:33.387 --> 01:13:35.287
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

01:13:35.289 --> 01:13:37.755
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

01:13:37.757 --> 01:13:40.359
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

01:13:40.361 --> 01:13:41.759
He gave you his eye?

01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:42.995
No, he gave me 100 credits.

01:13:42.997 --> 01:13:45.965
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.168
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:50.171
Hmm.

01:13:52.806 --> 01:13:54.208
Huh?

01:13:56.043 --> 01:13:57.342
Oh.

01:13:57.344 --> 01:14:00.145
I would've washed that.

01:14:00.147 --> 01:14:02.814
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

01:14:04.018 --> 01:14:05.085
Hey, we're here!

01:14:09.089 --> 01:14:10.322
I don't think
this thing works.

01:14:10.324 --> 01:14:11.658
Everything seems dark.

01:14:14.028 --> 01:14:15.795
It ain't the eye.

01:14:29.075 --> 01:14:30.377
Something's wrong.

01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:32.846
The star's gone out.

01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:35.181
And the rings are frozen.

01:14:56.302 --> 01:14:57.935
I hope
these dwarves are better

01:14:57.937 --> 01:14:59.804
at forging
than they are cleaning.

01:15:04.944 --> 01:15:06.477
Maybe they realized
that they live

01:15:06.479 --> 01:15:08.146
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

01:15:08.148 --> 01:15:11.117
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

01:15:13.353 --> 01:15:16.187
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:17.455
Yes, why?

01:15:17.457 --> 01:15:19.691
It look
anything like that?

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.962
I am Groot.

01:15:24.964 --> 01:15:26.366
Go back to the pod.

01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.404
Eitri, wait!

01:15:32.405 --> 01:15:33.406
Stop!

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.341
Stop.

01:15:36.109 --> 01:15:37.110
Thor?

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.213
What happened here?

01:15:42.215 --> 01:15:45.383
You were supposed
to protect us.

01:15:45.385 --> 01:15:48.219
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

01:15:48.221 --> 01:15:50.390
Asgard is destroyed.

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:56.462
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

01:16:09.275 --> 01:16:12.278
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

01:16:13.779 --> 01:16:16.715
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:20.486
I made what he wanted.

01:16:22.254 --> 01:16:26.725
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

01:16:31.163 --> 01:16:33.832
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.736
All except me.

01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:40.506
"Your life is yours," he said.

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:46.876
"But your hands
are mine alone."

01:16:46.878 --> 01:16:48.880
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

01:16:49.982 --> 01:16:51.515
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

01:16:51.517 --> 01:16:53.183
every axe, hammer, sword...

01:16:53.185 --> 01:16:56.253
it's all inside your head.

01:16:56.255 --> 01:16:58.321
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

01:16:58.323 --> 01:17:00.323
Trust me, I know.

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:05.097
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

01:17:45.504 --> 01:17:48.071
Mantis, listen very carefully.

01:17:48.073 --> 01:17:50.242
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:58.114
Hey, what's going on?

01:17:58.116 --> 01:17:59.416
I think we're here.

01:17:59.418 --> 01:18:01.986
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

01:18:03.588 --> 01:18:05.288
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.325
Close those around it.

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:09.225
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:10.527
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:12.290
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:18.100
We might wanna turn.

01:18:18.102 --> 01:18:19.304
Turn! Turn! Turn!

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:50.868
You all right?

01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:53.472
That was close.

01:18:54.972 --> 01:18:56.573
I owe you one.

01:18:56.575 --> 01:18:58.708
Let me just say, if aliens

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:00.643
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

01:19:00.645 --> 01:19:01.678
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.413
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

01:19:04.415 --> 01:19:06.148
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:07.830
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

01:19:15.059 --> 01:19:16.127
Thanos!

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:39.048
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

01:19:40.384 --> 01:19:42.953
Stay down, clown.

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:50.194
Die, blanket of death!

01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:59.069
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

01:20:00.237 --> 01:20:02.239
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

01:20:03.041 --> 01:20:04.373
Where is Gamora?

01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:07.209
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

01:20:07.211 --> 01:20:10.179
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:12.181
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:13.449
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

01:20:13.451 --> 01:20:17.051
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:19.655
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

01:20:19.657 --> 01:20:21.790
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:24.158
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.260
I'll kill all three of you

01:20:25.262 --> 01:20:27.262
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

01:20:27.264 --> 01:20:28.330
Starting with you.

01:20:28.332 --> 01:20:29.264
Wait, what, Thanos?

01:20:29.266 --> 01:20:32.133
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

01:20:32.135 --> 01:20:33.802
What master do you serve?

01:20:33.804 --> 01:20:35.269
What master do I serve?

01:20:35.271 --> 01:20:36.640
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

01:20:37.608 --> 01:20:38.507
You're from Earth.

01:20:38.509 --> 01:20:39.408
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:41.376
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.544
What are you hassling us for?

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.347
So you're not
with Thanos?

01:20:44.748 --> 01:20:47.248
With Thanos?

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:50.051
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:52.588
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:54.422
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

01:20:54.424 --> 01:20:56.792
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

01:20:56.794 --> 01:20:58.259
You know Thor?

01:20:58.261 --> 01:20:59.227
Yeah.

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:02.096
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

01:21:02.098 --> 01:21:03.634
Where is he now?

01:21:18.682 --> 01:21:20.716
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

01:21:20.718 --> 01:21:22.085
It's a mold.

01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:24.652
A king's weapon.

01:21:24.654 --> 01:21:27.622
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

01:21:27.624 --> 01:21:30.658
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.228
Did it have a name?

01:21:33.429 --> 01:21:35.129
Stormbreaker.

01:21:35.131 --> 01:21:36.232
That's a bit much.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:39.335
So how do we make it?

01:21:41.204 --> 01:21:43.373
You'll have to restart
the forge.

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.509
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

01:21:49.212 --> 01:21:51.714
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

01:21:55.451 --> 01:21:57.552
The hell happened
to this planet?

01:21:57.554 --> 01:21:59.453
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

01:21:59.455 --> 01:22:01.624
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

01:22:02.892 --> 01:22:06.694
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

01:22:06.696 --> 01:22:09.530
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

01:22:09.532 --> 01:22:10.865
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

01:22:10.867 --> 01:22:12.400
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

01:22:12.402 --> 01:22:13.701
pin him down,
get what we need.

01:22:13.703 --> 01:22:15.503
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

01:22:15.505 --> 01:22:17.204
We just want the gauntlet.

01:22:17.206 --> 01:22:19.574
Are you yawning?

01:22:19.576 --> 01:22:21.842
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

01:22:21.844 --> 01:22:23.678
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.213
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

01:22:26.215 --> 01:22:27.281
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

01:22:27.283 --> 01:22:30.418
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.152
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

01:22:32.154 --> 01:22:33.754
Kick names, take ass.

01:22:33.756 --> 01:22:35.157
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:43.531
All right, just get over here,
please.

01:22:43.533 --> 01:22:45.600
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

01:22:45.602 --> 01:22:47.737
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

01:22:50.506 --> 01:22:51.872
We gotta coalesce.

01:22:51.874 --> 01:22:53.708
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:56.276
Dude, don't call us plucky.

01:22:56.278 --> 01:22:57.745
We don't know what it means.

01:22:57.747 --> 01:23:00.548
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:03.249
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

01:23:03.251 --> 01:23:05.318
and that way
it might be really good.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.420
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

01:23:07.422 --> 01:23:09.657
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

01:23:09.659 --> 01:23:10.825
<i>Like in Footloose, the movie?</i>

01:23:10.827 --> 01:23:12.760
<i>Exactly like Footloose.</i>

01:23:12.762 --> 01:23:14.494
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

01:23:14.496 --> 01:23:15.730
It never was.

01:23:15.732 --> 01:23:16.831
Don't encourage this,
all right?

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.331
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:19.867
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.636
By the way,
that's a compliment.

01:23:21.638 --> 01:23:23.370
Don't forget, I'm half human.

01:23:23.372 --> 01:23:24.807
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

01:23:25.975 --> 01:23:27.307
that's 100% you.

01:23:27.309 --> 01:23:28.575
Your math
is blowing my mind.

01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:29.812
Excuse me.

01:23:30.813 --> 01:23:34.349
But does your friend
often do that?

01:23:35.684 --> 01:23:37.920
Strange, we all right?

01:23:48.363 --> 01:23:49.462
You're back. You're all right.

01:23:49.464 --> 01:23:51.698
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:56.336
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

01:23:56.338 --> 01:23:57.837
To see all
the possible outcomes

01:23:57.839 --> 01:23:59.708
of the coming conflict.

01:24:00.509 --> 01:24:01.908
How many did you see?

01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:04.312
14,000,605.

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:07.382
How many did we win?

01:24:11.987 --> 01:24:13.321
One.

01:24:35.044 --> 01:24:38.246
The stone
had better be up there.

01:24:39.948 --> 01:24:41.983
For your sister's sake.

01:25:02.904 --> 01:25:07.709
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

01:25:09.778 --> 01:25:13.312
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

01:25:13.314 --> 01:25:14.581
You know us?

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:19.619
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:21.355
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:25:21.923 --> 01:25:24.389
You should know...

01:25:24.391 --> 01:25:27.495
it extracts a terrible price.

01:25:28.764 --> 01:25:30.431
I am prepared.

01:25:32.801 --> 01:25:35.336
We all think that at first.

01:25:39.775 --> 01:25:42.011
We are all wrong.

01:25:53.687 --> 01:25:56.089
How is it you know
this place so well?

01:25:56.091 --> 01:26:00.927
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

01:26:00.929 --> 01:26:03.829
I even held one in my hand.

01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:08.002
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

01:26:08.004 --> 01:26:12.041
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

01:26:20.815 --> 01:26:23.751
What you seek
lies in front of you.

01:26:24.718 --> 01:26:26.821
As does what you fear.

01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:29.588
What's this?

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:31.157
The price.

01:26:31.159 --> 01:26:36.862
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:40.935
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

01:26:42.436 --> 01:26:44.436
Tell me what it needs.

01:26:44.438 --> 01:26:48.007
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

01:26:48.009 --> 01:26:50.644
understands its power...

01:26:51.612 --> 01:26:55.547
the stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:55.549 --> 01:26:57.516
Of what?

01:26:57.518 --> 01:26:59.551
In order to take the stone,

01:26:59.553 --> 01:27:01.889
you must lose
that which you love.

01:27:04.825 --> 01:27:06.060
A soul...

01:27:06.794 --> 01:27:07.995
for a soul.

01:27:23.777 --> 01:27:26.047
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

01:27:27.015 --> 01:27:28.514
a moment...

01:27:29.783 --> 01:27:31.852
when you got
what you deserved.

01:27:34.022 --> 01:27:36.456
And I was always
so disappointed.

01:27:39.927 --> 01:27:41.494
But now...

01:27:45.465 --> 01:27:48.534
You kill and torture...

01:27:50.503 --> 01:27:52.505
and you call it mercy.

01:27:56.576 --> 01:27:58.645
The universe has judged you.

01:28:00.114 --> 01:28:04.684
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.720
You failed.

01:28:09.024 --> 01:28:10.925
And do you wanna know why?

01:28:11.891 --> 01:28:13.760
Because you love nothing.

01:28:14.527 --> 01:28:16.031
No one.

01:28:21.734 --> 01:28:22.869
No.

01:28:27.573 --> 01:28:28.574
Really?

01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:30.677
Tears?

01:28:31.511 --> 01:28:33.479
They're not for him.

01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:48.861
No.

01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:51.798
This isn't love.

01:28:52.699 --> 01:28:55.234
I ignored my destiny once.

01:28:57.804 --> 01:28:59.939
I cannot do that again.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.843
Even for you.

01:29:28.002 --> 01:29:30.303
I'm sorry, little one.

01:29:34.173 --> 01:29:35.574
No!

01:31:13.071 --> 01:31:16.072
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

01:31:16.074 --> 01:31:17.407
I hope you're right
about this.

01:31:17.409 --> 01:31:20.312
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

01:31:36.094 --> 01:31:37.460
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

01:31:37.462 --> 01:31:38.862
to the rest of the world...

01:31:38.864 --> 01:31:41.164
this is not what I imagined.

01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:43.266
And what did you imagine?

01:31:43.268 --> 01:31:44.701
The Olympics.

01:31:44.703 --> 01:31:46.304
Maybe even a Starbucks.

01:32:00.485 --> 01:32:02.118
Should we bow?

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.786
Yeah, he's a king.

01:32:03.788 --> 01:32:05.789
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

01:32:06.925 --> 01:32:09.092
What are you doing?

01:32:09.094 --> 01:32:11.227
Uh, we don't do that here.

01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:13.762
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

01:32:13.764 --> 01:32:16.900
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

01:32:16.902 --> 01:32:17.967
How we looking?

01:32:17.969 --> 01:32:20.004
You will have my Kingsguard,

01:32:20.006 --> 01:32:23.939
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

01:32:23.941 --> 01:32:26.877
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.048
How you been, Buck?

01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:34.152
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

01:32:46.198 --> 01:32:47.297
Whoa.

01:32:47.299 --> 01:32:49.932
The structure is polymorphic.

01:32:49.934 --> 01:32:53.168
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.103
Why didn't you just reprogram

01:32:55.105 --> 01:32:57.209
the synapses
to work collectively?

01:32:58.276 --> 01:33:02.011
Because we didn't think of it.

01:33:02.013 --> 01:33:03.379
I'm sure you did your best.

01:33:03.381 --> 01:33:05.481
Can you do it?

01:33:05.483 --> 01:33:09.051
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

01:33:09.053 --> 01:33:12.488
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:13.757
It will take time, brother.

01:33:15.326 --> 01:33:16.426
How long?

01:33:16.428 --> 01:33:17.859
As long as you can give me.

01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:24.502
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

01:33:41.385 --> 01:33:43.821
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.830
God, I love this place.

01:33:54.832 --> 01:33:56.999
<i>Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.</i>

01:33:57.002 --> 01:33:58.936
<i>We got more incoming
outside the dome.</i>

01:34:18.122 --> 01:34:19.189
It's too late.

01:34:20.224 --> 01:34:22.090
We need to destroy
the stone now.

01:34:22.092 --> 01:34:23.925
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

01:34:23.927 --> 01:34:25.327
We will hold them off.

01:34:25.329 --> 01:34:28.997
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

01:34:28.999 --> 01:34:30.001
you blow it to hell.

01:34:30.334 --> 01:34:31.533
I will.

01:34:31.535 --> 01:34:34.371
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

01:34:35.172 --> 01:34:36.540
And get this man a shield.

01:34:47.083 --> 01:34:48.216
<i>I don't think</i>

01:34:48.218 --> 01:34:49.584
<i>you get the scientifics here.</i>

01:34:49.586 --> 01:34:52.154
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

01:34:52.156 --> 01:34:53.522
<i>you're gonna need something
a lot bigger</i>

01:34:53.524 --> 01:34:54.889
<i>to yank 'em loose.</i>

01:34:54.891 --> 01:34:57.058
<i>- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?</i>

01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:00.228
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

01:35:08.505 --> 01:35:09.571
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

01:35:27.156 --> 01:35:29.892
More power, rabbit!

01:36:01.257 --> 01:36:03.092
Well done, boy.

01:36:04.728 --> 01:36:06.662
That's Nidavellir.

01:36:26.716 --> 01:36:28.249
Damn it.

01:36:28.251 --> 01:36:30.018
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.419
<i>The mechanism
is crippled.</i>

01:36:31.421 --> 01:36:33.021
- What?
- With the iris closed,

01:36:33.023 --> 01:36:34.188
I can't heat the metal.

01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:35.990
How long will it take
to heat it?

01:36:35.992 --> 01:36:38.294
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

01:36:40.296 --> 01:36:41.462
I'm gonna hold it open.

01:36:41.464 --> 01:36:42.696
That's suicide.

01:36:42.698 --> 01:36:45.234
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

01:36:55.076 --> 01:36:56.043
How we looking, Bruce?

01:36:56.045 --> 01:36:57.979
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

01:37:01.217 --> 01:37:03.350
Wow! This is amazing, man.

01:37:03.352 --> 01:37:05.352
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:11.327
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

01:37:12.728 --> 01:37:13.794
I've got two heat signatures

01:37:13.796 --> 01:37:14.996
breaking through
the tree line.

01:37:43.358 --> 01:37:46.059
Thank you
for standing with us.

01:38:07.516 --> 01:38:09.817
Where's your other friend?

01:38:09.819 --> 01:38:12.320
You will pay for his life
with yours.

01:38:13.321 --> 01:38:16.289
Thanos will have that stone.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:17.791
That's not gonna happen.

01:38:17.793 --> 01:38:20.360
You are in Wakanda now.

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:23.732
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

01:38:27.135 --> 01:38:29.102
We have blood to spare.

01:38:40.382 --> 01:38:41.816
They surrender?

01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:43.716
Not exactly.

01:39:10.679 --> 01:39:12.213
What the hell?

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.749
Looks like we pissed her off.

01:39:27.495 --> 01:39:29.129
They're killing themselves.

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:06.866
You see the teeth
on those things?

01:40:06.868 --> 01:40:07.934
All right, back up, Sam.

01:40:07.936 --> 01:40:09.297
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:22.949
<i>Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter</i>

01:40:22.951 --> 01:40:24.083
<i>and get in behind us...</i>

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:26.451
<i>there's nothing
between them and Vision.</i>

01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:28.420
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:29.690
How do we do that?

01:40:31.993 --> 01:40:33.694
We open the barrier.

01:40:35.897 --> 01:40:40.465
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:42.434
<i>Requesting
confirmation, My King.</i>

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:44.302
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:45.671
On my signal.

01:40:45.673 --> 01:40:47.574
This will be
the end of Wakanda.

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:52.379
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.792
Wakanda forever!

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:20.274
Now!

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.004
How much longer, Shuri?

01:41:52.006 --> 01:41:53.772
I've barely begun, brother.

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:55.642
You might want to pick up
the pace.

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:04.716
Allfathers, give me strength.

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.685
You understand, boy?

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:09.690
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

01:42:10.657 --> 01:42:12.724
It'll kill you.

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:14.895
Only if I die.

01:42:15.328 --> 01:42:16.728
Yes.

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.532
That's what killing you means.

01:42:47.527 --> 01:42:49.462
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:41.814
Thor! Say something. Come on.

01:43:42.748 --> 01:43:43.749
Thor, you okay?

01:43:49.488 --> 01:43:50.855
I think he's dying.

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:52.825
He needs the axe!

01:43:54.193 --> 01:43:55.661
Where's the handle?

01:43:58.698 --> 01:44:00.967
Tree, help me find the handle!

01:45:09.868 --> 01:45:12.038
There's too many of 'em!

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:41.965
You guys
are so screwed now!

01:45:45.203 --> 01:45:47.270
Bring me Thanos!

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.605
Oh, yeah.

01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:26.711
You're much more of a Thanos.

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:31.116
I take it the Maw is dead.

01:46:33.351 --> 01:46:35.920
This day
extracts a heavy toll.

01:46:37.688 --> 01:46:40.189
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:41.793
You may regret that.

01:46:42.659 --> 01:46:44.028
He brought you face-to-face

01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.562
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

01:46:48.699 --> 01:46:51.069
And where do you think
he brought you?

01:46:52.137 --> 01:46:54.906
Let me guess. Your home?

01:46:59.210 --> 01:47:00.644
It was.

01:47:03.248 --> 01:47:04.782
And it was beautiful.

01:47:07.285 --> 01:47:09.985
Titan was like most planets.

01:47:09.987 --> 01:47:13.022
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

01:47:13.024 --> 01:47:16.227
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

01:47:17.228 --> 01:47:19.162
Genocide.

01:47:19.164 --> 01:47:23.234
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

01:47:24.701 --> 01:47:27.403
They called me a madman.

01:47:27.405 --> 01:47:29.807
And what I predicted
came to pass.

01:47:32.377 --> 01:47:34.578
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

01:47:35.046 --> 01:47:36.345
I'm a survivor.

01:47:36.347 --> 01:47:38.847
Who wants to murder trillions.

01:47:38.849 --> 01:47:43.051
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

01:47:43.053 --> 01:47:47.825
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

01:47:49.893 --> 01:47:51.295
And then what?

01:47:52.763 --> 01:47:54.996
I'd finally rest...

01:47:54.998 --> 01:47:59.234
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

01:47:59.236 --> 01:48:03.738
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:08.312
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

01:48:09.847 --> 01:48:10.848
Our?

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.386
Piece of cake, Quill.

01:48:18.388 --> 01:48:20.791
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

01:48:58.929 --> 01:49:00.295
Boom!

01:49:00.297 --> 01:49:03.066
Don't let him close his fist.

01:49:07.237 --> 01:49:08.238
Magic.

01:49:08.938 --> 01:49:09.939
More magic.

01:49:10.806 --> 01:49:11.807
Magic with a kick.

01:49:12.309 --> 01:49:13.310
Magic with a...

01:49:14.777 --> 01:49:16.013
Insect!

01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:54.782
Well, well.

01:49:54.784 --> 01:49:55.950
You should've killed me.

01:49:55.952 --> 01:49:57.785
It would've been
a waste of parts!

01:50:03.226 --> 01:50:04.391
Where's Gamora?

01:50:45.601 --> 01:50:46.967
<i>Is he under?
Don't let up.</i>

01:50:46.969 --> 01:50:49.603
Be quick. He is very strong.

01:50:49.605 --> 01:50:51.972
Parker, help! Get over here.

01:50:51.974 --> 01:50:54.243
<i>She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.</i>

01:50:59.615 --> 01:51:00.948
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:02.116
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

01:51:02.118 --> 01:51:03.398
For the record,
this was my plan.

01:51:04.553 --> 01:51:06.322
You're not so strong now, huh?

01:51:06.922 --> 01:51:08.589
Where is Gamora?

01:51:08.591 --> 01:51:10.890
My Gamora.

01:51:10.892 --> 01:51:13.160
No, bullshit!

01:51:13.162 --> 01:51:14.397
Where is she?

01:51:15.464 --> 01:51:16.898
He is in anguish.

01:51:17.466 --> 01:51:19.533
Good.

01:51:19.535 --> 01:51:22.436
He... He mourns.

01:51:22.438 --> 01:51:26.142
What does
this monster have to mourn?

01:51:26.908 --> 01:51:27.976
Gamora.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.213
What?

01:51:33.215 --> 01:51:35.316
He took her to Vormir.

01:51:35.318 --> 01:51:37.286
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

01:51:38.119 --> 01:51:39.522
But she didn't.

01:51:41.457 --> 01:51:45.492
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

01:51:45.494 --> 01:51:49.064
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

01:51:50.266 --> 01:51:51.267
Tell me she's lying.

01:51:53.636 --> 01:51:56.472
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:01.377
I had to.

01:52:02.177 --> 01:52:03.577
No, you didn't.

01:52:03.579 --> 01:52:05.414
No, you didn't.

01:52:09.284 --> 01:52:10.684
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

01:52:10.686 --> 01:52:13.286
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:52:13.288 --> 01:52:14.521
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

01:52:14.523 --> 01:52:16.764
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:20.962
Oh, God.

01:53:19.354 --> 01:53:23.055
Come and get some,
space dogs!

01:53:25.693 --> 01:53:28.494
Come on! Get some! Get some!

01:53:28.496 --> 01:53:30.630
Come on! Get some!

01:53:30.632 --> 01:53:33.366
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

01:53:33.368 --> 01:53:35.270
Okay. How much for the arm?

01:53:37.172 --> 01:53:39.238
Oh, I'll get that arm.

01:53:48.081 --> 01:53:49.382
New haircut?

01:53:49.384 --> 01:53:50.618
Noticed you've copied
my beard.

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.122
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

01:53:56.056 --> 01:53:57.991
I am Groot.

01:53:58.793 --> 01:54:00.693
I am Steve Rogers.

01:54:20.414 --> 01:54:22.550
Fall back! Fall back, now!

01:54:32.092 --> 01:54:34.326
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

01:54:34.328 --> 01:54:35.429
I'm doing it.

01:54:59.353 --> 01:55:01.054
Why was she up there
all this time?

01:55:01.823 --> 01:55:04.725
She's on the field. Take it.

01:55:36.423 --> 01:55:38.590
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

01:55:41.328 --> 01:55:43.428
Somebody get to Vision!

01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:45.265
<i>- I got him!
- On my way.</i>

01:55:50.571 --> 01:55:53.572
He'll die alone. As will you.

01:55:53.574 --> 01:55:54.808
She's not alone.

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:22.901
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

01:56:22.903 --> 01:56:24.603
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

01:56:24.605 --> 01:56:27.171
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

01:56:27.173 --> 01:56:28.238
<i>What? No! No!</i>

01:56:31.778 --> 01:56:34.548
<i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i>

01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:38.282
Hulk? Hulk,

01:56:38.284 --> 01:56:40.351
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

01:56:40.353 --> 01:56:42.856
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

01:56:47.426 --> 01:56:48.862
Hulk! Hulk!

01:56:49.763 --> 01:56:50.764
Hulk!

01:56:51.898 --> 01:56:54.365
No!

01:56:54.367 --> 01:56:57.301
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!

01:56:57.303 --> 01:56:58.471
I'll do it myself!

01:56:59.405 --> 01:57:01.273
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

01:57:13.552 --> 01:57:15.285
<i>See ya!</i>

01:57:26.666 --> 01:57:29.333
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

01:57:40.312 --> 01:57:42.214
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

01:57:42.982 --> 01:57:45.618
But you're dying,
like any man.

01:57:54.293 --> 01:57:55.494
Get outta here!

01:57:58.831 --> 01:57:59.865
Go!

01:58:18.651 --> 01:58:20.386
That was really gross.

01:58:47.512 --> 01:58:48.592
I thought I told you to go.

01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:52.018
We don't trade lives, Captain.

01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:05.661
I got you. I got you.

01:59:05.663 --> 01:59:07.665
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

01:59:52.877 --> 01:59:54.544
You're full of tricks, wizard.

01:59:56.548 --> 01:59:59.484
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

02:00:02.821 --> 02:00:03.886
A fake.

02:00:11.796 --> 02:00:15.498
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:16.766
Stark.

02:00:16.768 --> 02:00:17.836
You know me?

02:00:18.536 --> 02:00:20.069
I do.

02:00:20.071 --> 02:00:23.374
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

02:00:24.108 --> 02:00:25.577
My only curse is you.

02:00:28.047 --> 02:00:29.048
Come on!

02:00:57.009 --> 02:00:58.977
All that for a drop of blood.

02:01:43.022 --> 02:01:44.855
You have my respect, Stark.

02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:49.760
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

02:01:55.166 --> 02:01:57.434
I hope they remember you.

02:02:07.077 --> 02:02:08.178
Stop.

02:02:14.618 --> 02:02:15.619
Spare his life...

02:02:17.254 --> 02:02:19.056
and I will give you the stone.

02:02:22.693 --> 02:02:23.927
No tricks.

02:02:28.765 --> 02:02:29.766
Don't.

02:03:21.118 --> 02:03:22.886
One to go.

02:03:32.795 --> 02:03:34.131
Where is he?

02:03:43.106 --> 02:03:44.607
Did we just lose?

02:03:48.345 --> 02:03:50.280
Why would you do that?

02:03:53.749 --> 02:03:55.951
We're in the endgame now.

02:04:20.776 --> 02:04:23.344
Are you okay?

02:04:25.247 --> 02:04:27.081
What? What is it?

02:04:29.151 --> 02:04:30.252
He's here.

02:04:41.263 --> 02:04:44.300
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

02:04:47.103 --> 02:04:49.071
What the hell?

02:05:14.697 --> 02:05:15.698
Cap.

02:05:16.298 --> 02:05:17.867
That's him.

02:05:19.902 --> 02:05:22.371
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

02:05:46.962 --> 02:05:47.963
Wanda.

02:05:49.064 --> 02:05:50.430
It's time.

02:05:50.432 --> 02:05:51.764
No.

02:05:51.766 --> 02:05:54.067
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:55.735
Look at me.

02:05:55.737 --> 02:05:56.936
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

02:05:56.938 --> 02:05:58.005
Don't.

02:05:58.007 --> 02:05:59.207
You must do it. Wanda, please.

02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:03.778
We are out of time.

02:06:04.413 --> 02:06:05.845
I can't.

02:06:05.847 --> 02:06:07.183
Yes, you can.

02:06:07.916 --> 02:06:09.118
You can.

02:06:10.519 --> 02:06:12.954
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

02:06:15.257 --> 02:06:16.858
It's not fair.

02:06:18.027 --> 02:06:19.694
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

02:06:21.463 --> 02:06:23.032
It's all right.

02:06:24.366 --> 02:06:26.134
You could never hurt me.

02:06:35.176 --> 02:06:37.012
I just feel you.

02:08:00.128 --> 02:08:01.229
It's all right.

02:08:11.172 --> 02:08:12.440
It's all right.

02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:17.978
I love you.

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:49.343
I understand, my child.

02:08:50.977 --> 02:08:52.480
Better than anyone.

02:08:54.214 --> 02:08:56.149
You could never.

02:09:01.022 --> 02:09:04.025
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:08.362
But now is no time to mourn.

02:09:10.565 --> 02:09:14.568
Now is no time at all.

02:09:38.025 --> 02:09:39.026
No!

02:10:37.017 --> 02:10:38.385
I told you...

02:10:39.719 --> 02:10:41.555
you'd die for that.

02:10:56.036 --> 02:10:57.637
You should have...

02:11:00.339 --> 02:11:01.708
You should...

02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:07.514
You should have
gone for the head.

02:11:09.448 --> 02:11:10.449
No!

02:11:43.782 --> 02:11:45.150
Daughter?

02:11:52.658 --> 02:11:54.159
Did you do it?

02:11:56.095 --> 02:11:57.096
Yes.

02:12:05.437 --> 02:12:07.106
What did it cost?

02:12:10.676 --> 02:12:12.278
Everything.

02:12:22.488 --> 02:12:24.123
What did you do?

02:12:25.324 --> 02:12:26.725
What'd you do?

02:12:40.439 --> 02:12:41.740
Where'd he go?

02:12:44.677 --> 02:12:45.842
Thor.

02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:50.814
Where'd he go?

02:12:50.816 --> 02:12:52.216
Steve?

02:13:26.885 --> 02:13:29.786
Up, General. Up!

02:13:29.788 --> 02:13:31.387
This is no place to die.

02:13:46.371 --> 02:13:47.904
I am Groot.

02:13:47.906 --> 02:13:49.540
Oh...

02:13:50.441 --> 02:13:52.510
No, no, no!

02:13:53.378 --> 02:13:56.247
Groot! No.

02:14:09.594 --> 02:14:10.728
Sam!

02:14:14.766 --> 02:14:16.467
Sam, where you at?

02:14:25.743 --> 02:14:27.912
Something's happening.

02:14:40.025 --> 02:14:41.359
Quill?

02:14:48.666 --> 02:14:49.932
Steady, Quill.

02:14:49.934 --> 02:14:51.234
Oh, man.

02:14:55.373 --> 02:14:56.374
Tony.

02:14:59.811 --> 02:15:02.380
There was no other way.

02:15:07.919 --> 02:15:08.920
Mr. Stark?

02:15:13.491 --> 02:15:14.759
I don't feel so good.

02:15:16.828 --> 02:15:17.727
You're all right.

02:15:17.729 --> 02:15:19.029
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

02:15:19.031 --> 02:15:20.665
I don't know...

02:15:22.466 --> 02:15:23.599
I don't want to go.

02:15:23.601 --> 02:15:25.500
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

02:15:25.502 --> 02:15:28.271
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

02:15:32.710 --> 02:15:34.311
I'm sorry.

02:15:48.993 --> 02:15:50.560
He did it.

02:16:15.385 --> 02:16:18.555
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

02:16:35.472 --> 02:16:37.073
Oh, God.

02:27:33.425 --> 02:27:35.025
<i>Still no word
from Stark?</i>

02:27:35.027 --> 02:27:36.358
<i>No, not yet.</i>

02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:37.461
<i>We're watching every satellite</i>

02:27:37.463 --> 02:27:39.629
<i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i>

02:27:39.631 --> 02:27:41.731
What is it?

02:27:41.733 --> 02:27:44.333
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.

02:27:44.335 --> 02:27:46.402
Same energy signature
as New York?

02:27:46.404 --> 02:27:47.673
Ten times bigger.

02:27:49.273 --> 02:27:50.439
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...

02:27:50.441 --> 02:27:51.541
Nick! Nick!

02:28:05.189 --> 02:28:06.424
They okay?

02:28:07.425 --> 02:28:09.291
There's no one here.

02:28:18.669 --> 02:28:20.271
Call Control.

02:28:21.072 --> 02:28:22.306
Code red.

02:28:22.841 --> 02:28:24.042
Nick.

02:28:25.576 --> 02:28:26.577
Hill.

02:28:41.526 --> 02:28:42.660
Oh, no.

02:28:44.362 --> 02:28:45.363
Mother...
