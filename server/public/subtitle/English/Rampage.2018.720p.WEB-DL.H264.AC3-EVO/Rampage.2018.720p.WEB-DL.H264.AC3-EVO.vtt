00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:26.424
Athena-1.
Athena-1, <i>come in.</i>

00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:30.829
Athena-1, <i>this is Control. We have
negative copy on that last transmission.</i>

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.933
<i>We are showing LOS in the command module.
Please verify. Over.</i>

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:36.336
Mission Control,
this is Atkins.

00:01:36.338 --> 00:01:38.338
Something went wrong
with the test.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.372
The crew is dead.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:42.740
<i>Athena</i> hull integrity
is critical.

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:44.776
I'm headed
to the escape capsule.

00:01:44.778 --> 00:01:47.179
<i>Negative, negative.
Reroute to the lab and</i>

00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:49.048
<i>secure the canisters
before departure.</i>

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.016
But the test subject is loose.

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:53.353
<i>Doctor, the test subject
is a rat.</i>

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:54.688
Not anymore.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.228
What is this?

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.460
<i>You have your orders, Doctor.</i>

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.695
Open the goddamn door!

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:06.698
<i>Dr. Atkins, it's Claire Wyden.</i>

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.238
<i>We'll unlock the escape capsule
when you secure the samples.</i>

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.410
<i>Doctor, either you come home
with my research,</i>

00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:20.215
<i>or you don't come home at all.</i>

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:48.976
Entering the lab.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.084
Okay.

00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:09.761
Mission Control, securing
the samples now.

00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:10.866
<i>Copy that.</i>

00:03:27.013 --> 00:03:28.880
<i>Warning,
hull integrity critical.</i>

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:35.457
Oh, God.

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:48.401
Open it!

00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:50.005
<i>Capsule unlocked.</i>

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.301
Mmm. I love that smell.

00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:30.735
Brings me right back to
Uganda.

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:31.937
You've been to Uganda?

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.605
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:36.007
If the jungle doesn't kill
you, the poachers will.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.476
<i>The cops are still after me
from all that shit I pulled.</i>

00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:40.313
<i>They call me</i> El Diablo.

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:41.447
I know they don't speak Spanish,
but they might as well.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.182
Right.

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:45.418
- You ever see <i>Blood Diamond?</i>
- Yeah.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.985
Now, I know it's about diamonds,
but it really captures the vibe.

00:05:47.987 --> 00:05:50.588
I don't know if it's the same region.
But, you know, it's intense.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.192
<i>Don't mess with
Mother Africa...</i>

00:05:57.797 --> 00:05:59.267
Everything okay, boss?

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:02.304
No, it's not.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.004
Don't move a muscle.

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.973
Junior here is dropping
a lot of monkey shit

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:11.178
with these made-up stories.

00:06:14.782 --> 00:06:17.185
It's very entertaining, though.
It's very entertaining.

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:20.952
I've been to Uganda, man.

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:23.388
And I've been to Hogwarts.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.624
Regardless, if you had any
experience with poaching,

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:29.660
you would know that it's extremely rude
to talk about it in front of a lady.

00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:32.298
Oh, it's okay.
I can handle it.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.137
Oh, I know you can. I'm
talking about these ladies.

00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:58.557
There shouldn't be any
problems,

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:00.392
but remember you're not
in the classroom anymore.

00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:03.528
These are wild animals.
They're very unpredictable.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.533
So remember your training,
and do exactly as I say.

00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.437
Tell me, what do you see?

00:07:13.274 --> 00:07:15.207
The, uh, the young male,

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:20.444
is attempting to establish his
presence with the female.

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:23.383
<i>He's posturing, agitated.</i>

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.550
Sounds like someone we know,
right?

00:07:25.552 --> 00:07:28.253
Okay, let's remember this is Paavo's
first interaction with the troop.

00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:29.855
<i>So we'll just take it
nice and easy,</i>

00:07:29.857 --> 00:07:32.594
and we'll see how well he
responds to my commands.

00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:35.864
I...

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:44.406
Paavo.

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:47.773
Paavo. Paavo, it's okay.

00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:49.644
Femi, Enu, on station.

00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:53.144
<i>Good girls.</i>

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:55.917
Easy.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.251
That's far enough, Paavo.

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:01.452
It's okay.
Calm. Calm.

00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:02.956
It's me.

00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:09.298
Calm.

00:08:10.497 --> 00:08:12.163
<i>There you go.</i>

00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:13.265
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:14.269
<i>Good boy.</i>

00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:19.471
Good boy.

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:20.941
Good boy.

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:30.117
Uh... Davis.

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:39.523
Everyone stay where you are.
No one move.

00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:41.626
Are you crazy?

00:08:41.628 --> 00:08:42.661
If you move, we're gonna be in big trouble.
Connor, do not move.

00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:44.799
Connor, do what he says.

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:46.932
<i>Paavo...</i>

00:08:46.934 --> 00:08:48.836
Connor, don't move!

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:50.869
Paavo!

00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.607
No! Paavo! Shit!

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.341
<i>Help! Help!</i>

00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:07.386
Connor! Connor!

00:09:07.388 --> 00:09:08.720
It's okay.

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:10.455
George! George!

00:09:10.457 --> 00:09:12.391
George!

00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:16.029
George!
Easy, buddy. Easy.

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:23.701
Okay. Okay.

00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:26.239
Oh, very funny. Very funny.

00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:28.374
<i>We're all very impressed.
Yes, yes.</i>

00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:30.208
You and I, laughing at your
joke, okay?

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.146
New guy, he no laugh.

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.645
He cry.

00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:37.749
<i>Yeah. Yeah, opposite of laugh.</i>

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.018
- Connor, you can get up now.
- Are you 100% on that?

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.420
100% sure. You can get up.

00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:43.490
And check your diaper.
Come on, let's go.

00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:45.759
He cry.

00:09:48.363 --> 00:09:49.528
It's okay, it's okay.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.495
He's not gonna kill me?

00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:54.057
No, he's not gonna kill you. He
has a unique sense of humor. I...

00:09:58.171 --> 00:09:59.371
Uh, no, no.

00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:01.243
George no save Davis.

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:04.209
I don't need your saving. No.

00:10:04.211 --> 00:10:05.844
George no save Davis.
You didn't save me.

00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:08.380
I was fine on my own.
I'm fine.

00:10:08.382 --> 00:10:12.020
Stop doing that. Listen, it's important
for you to be nice to Paavo.

00:10:12.886 --> 00:10:14.521
<i>He's just a kid.</i>

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.727
Poachers killed his entire
family.

00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:23.197
<i>He's in your troop now.</i>

00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:25.931
<i>I want you to welcome him.</i>

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:27.635
Welcome Paavo.

00:10:34.907 --> 00:10:36.777
George, you and I cool?

00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:39.546
Come on.

00:10:46.152 --> 00:10:48.455
Wow, I can't,
Come on.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.324
I should never have taught you
that. Stop that.

00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:53.759
Now, come on. Give me,

00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:56.094
Come on! Don't do that.

00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:59.130
Stop that! Okay.
All right, listen.

00:10:59.132 --> 00:11:02.069
I need you to protect Paavo.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.975
Family.

00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:22.520
I started using this new
vegan deodorant.

00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:24.822
- How's that?
- I smell like guacamole.

00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:27.293
Hey! Davis.

00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:28.493
Hey.

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:31.297
Hi. Look,
I just wanted to say,

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.631
that was amazing out there.

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:35.700
Ah, thank you.

00:11:35.702 --> 00:11:38.669
And I would love to learn more
about those submission techniques.

00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:40.641
If you have time for a drink?

00:11:42.543 --> 00:11:44.042
Yes!

00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:45.509
Your allergies acting up
again?

00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:46.677
It's the dander.

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:48.280
- It's the dander.
- <i>Animal dander.</i>

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:49.815
Mmm-hmm. Uh...

00:11:49.817 --> 00:11:51.217
Thank you, anyway.
I appreciate it.

00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:52.551
I already have plans tonight.

00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:53.552
You did great out there today.
Okay?

00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:55.519
Oh, I didn't do anything.

00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:57.188
Exactly. The first rule of
dealing with hostile animals is,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.358
you wanna remain calm.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.395
I was gonna bake some kale bread
tonight, if you're interested.

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:07.299
No, I know you have a gluten thing.
All right, see you in the morning.

00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:09.801
She used the word
"submission." That's a clue.

00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:12.003
Should I go back there and tell her your
plans are to hang out with your dogs?

00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:15.408
Come on, you know me, Nelson.
I need my "me" time.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.042
Your "me" time?

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:19.177
Okay. Listen, buddy,

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:21.291
since everyone else is afraid to
tell you this, of course I will.

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:22.417
It's, um...

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:25.351
Uh, what's the terminology?

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:28.357
Weird you like hanging out
with animals more than people.

00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:31.188
They get me.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.023
Animals like you, they lick you.
They don't like you, they eat you.

00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:35.059
You always know where you
stand.

00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:37.230
Or where you lie. All chewed up in
their belly 'cause they ate you.

00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:39.730
Yeah, that's just some food for thought.
And by the way, you're the food.

00:12:39.732 --> 00:12:41.932
All right, get outta here,
you big lug.

00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:43.236
Say hi to the dogs for me.

00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:44.605
I will.

00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:53.881
Girls love him.

00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:57.352
I should shave my head.

00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:24.668
I got your message about
George. He okay?

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.804
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:28.041
Davis. Davis!

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.978
He's in the grizzly enclosure.

00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:34.682
What?

00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:51.531
Jesus.

00:15:03.377 --> 00:15:05.310
- Put it down.
- What?

00:15:05.312 --> 00:15:07.077
You know how he is around guns.
Put it down.

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.380
Are you sure?

00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:10.584
Put it down.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:22.331
Hey, George?

00:15:23.497 --> 00:15:24.865
It's okay.

00:15:25.564 --> 00:15:26.733
It's me.

00:15:28.702 --> 00:15:29.937
It's me.

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:38.045
What happened?

00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:42.681
You're sad.

00:15:42.683 --> 00:15:44.386
It's okay.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.521
Did you hurt him?

00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:50.757
"Sorry"?

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:53.893
It's okay.

00:16:00.067 --> 00:16:01.869
Did he hurt you?

00:16:04.603 --> 00:16:06.307
He made you scared.

00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:08.642
It's okay.

00:16:10.142 --> 00:16:11.144
It's...

00:16:12.612 --> 00:16:14.548
George.

00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:16.417
George.

00:16:17.918 --> 00:16:19.250
It's okay to be scared.

00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:21.488
It's okay.
Calm.

00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:25.393
Easy.

00:16:35.268 --> 00:16:38.270
Is it me or is he
considerably bigger?

00:16:38.272 --> 00:16:40.605
No, he's definitely bigger.

00:16:40.607 --> 00:16:42.341
<i>It's Connor.</i>

00:16:42.343 --> 00:16:44.383
<i>Guys, you need to get over
to the gorilla enclosure.</i>

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.190
What the hell happened?

00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:00.259
We were doing our morning
rounds when we saw the burnt foliage,

00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:02.527
and found this.

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:04.030
All right, let me see the kit.

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:22.213
What is it?

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:25.485
I don't know.
But we gotta figure it out.

00:17:27.854 --> 00:17:30.521
<i>Stupid piece of crap!</i>

00:17:30.523 --> 00:17:32.025
<i>Mini space station!</i>

00:17:34.728 --> 00:17:35.963
Are you done?

00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:40.164
We just lost billions of
dollars, Claire.

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:41.865
Tens of billions, actually.

00:17:41.867 --> 00:17:44.969
Plus $20,000 for the models
you just destroyed.

00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:46.874
Our stock got hammered this
morning.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.873
Down 20%.

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.842
And you aren't upset,
because...

00:17:50.844 --> 00:17:53.678
Because Project Rampage works.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.181
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Zero.

00:17:56.183 --> 00:17:59.417
Because all of our research
was on that space station.

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:01.054
Actually,

00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:05.257
Atkins got the research
samples onto the escape pod.

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:07.326
<i>Yes, the escape pod blew up.</i>

00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:10.662
But the canisters were
engineered to withstand reentry.

00:18:10.664 --> 00:18:13.264
And the American Meteor Society
just reported a meteor strike

00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:14.865
in southern Wyoming.

00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:18.903
All we have to do is go
get it back.

00:18:18.905 --> 00:18:20.704
Well, let's get out there!

00:18:20.706 --> 00:18:23.375
Somebody finds that sample,
it leads straight back to us.

00:18:23.377 --> 00:18:25.576
Please, enough with the
overreacting.

00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:27.378
I am not overreacting, Claire.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.713
There's a reason we were doing
these experiments in space.

00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:31.795
And it wasn't exactly for
the betterment of humanity.

00:18:32.352 --> 00:18:33.718
Okay.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.586
Look,

00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:37.222
you handle the press,

00:18:37.224 --> 00:18:39.391
and I'll get Burke to take
care of the canister.

00:18:39.393 --> 00:18:41.359
Who is Burke?

00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:43.362
Remember that private military
firm we acquired last year?

00:18:43.364 --> 00:18:45.195
You called them "Killers
'R' Us."

00:18:45.197 --> 00:18:47.598
Yeah?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.736
Well, he's the "us."

00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:13.325
Boss.

00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:15.496
<i>Wheels up! You boys are
Oscar Mike.</i>

00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:17.463
Let's do it.

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:30.807
<i>Where to, Burke?</i>

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:31.976
<i>Wyoming.</i>

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:33.443
<i>Ah, never been.</i>

00:19:33.445 --> 00:19:35.512
<i>Lots of mountains,
not a lot of people.</i>

00:19:35.514 --> 00:19:38.084
<i>Animals love it.
You'll fit right in.</i>

00:20:04.944 --> 00:20:06.644
Shit.

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:08.680
Hey, Mark.

00:20:08.682 --> 00:20:10.448
<i>Where the hell are you? Do you
have any idea what time it is?</i>

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.819
Yes, yes. Um...

00:20:12.985 --> 00:20:14.152
Yeah, sorry.

00:20:14.154 --> 00:20:16.656
I am on the freeway,

00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:22.160
I know I've already been late
twice this week,

00:20:22.162 --> 00:20:24.494
but it will not happen again.

00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:27.131
<i>Brett Wyden addressed the
situation with this brief statement.</i>

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:30.368
<i>My sister and I and everyone at
Energyne are stunned and deeply saddened</i>

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.304
<i>by the loss of the</i> Athena-1
<i>crew.</i>

00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:34.672
<i>These were brave and brilliant
men and women of science,</i>

00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:36.740
<i>who were committed to helping
mankind,</i>

00:20:36.742 --> 00:20:38.710
<i>and we will continue that work
in their honor.</i>

00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:39.911
<i>That's enough.
Thank you.</i>

00:20:39.913 --> 00:20:43.580
Helping mankind, my ass.

00:20:43.582 --> 00:20:47.518
<i>Since then, Wall Street has kept a
close eye on Energyne's performance.</i>

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.886
<i>Now to politics...</i>

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:52.257
<i>What you're looking at is
dramatic video of a fireball</i>

00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:55.192
<i>touching down near the San
Diego Wildlife Sanctuary.</i>

00:20:55.194 --> 00:20:58.863
<i>It is thought to be debris from
last night's</i> Athena-1 <i>tragedy.</i>

00:20:58.865 --> 00:21:00.597
<i>However, it's unclear
if this is related</i>

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:03.000
<i>to one of the park's gorillas
escaping the enclosure</i>

00:21:03.002 --> 00:21:04.434
<i>at the sanctuary earlier
this morning.</i>

00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:06.170
<i>The gorilla's name is
George...</i>

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:09.173
Hold on a second, Mark.
The car ahead of me...

00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:11.875
- It just exploded.
- <i>What?</i>

00:21:11.877 --> 00:21:14.846
<i>There is currently no explanation
for the primate's behavior,</i>

00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:17.249
<i>and zoo officials are not
commenting at this time.</i>

00:21:17.251 --> 00:21:20.451
<i>Our very own Jason Sloss is at
the scene. Jason, what have you heard?</i>

00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:22.086
<i>That's right,
Chris and Maria.</i>

00:21:22.088 --> 00:21:23.554
<i>I'm here at the San Diego
Wildlife Sanctuary,</i>

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:25.289
<i>and the word
everyone seems to be using</i>

00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:28.396
<i>to describe the gorilla's
escape is "surprising."</i>

00:21:40.307 --> 00:21:42.277
<i>There. Set her down.</i>

00:22:06.832 --> 00:22:10.167
<i>We've secured the canister, but
it was pretty badly damaged.</i>

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:12.804
<i>Whatever was in it
was destroyed.</i>

00:22:12.806 --> 00:22:13.941
<i>There's something else.</i>

00:22:15.508 --> 00:22:17.442
<i>These wolves were slaughtered.</i>

00:22:17.444 --> 00:22:21.245
<i>From the tracks, looks like
another one killed the pack.</i>

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:22.915
It's infected with the
pathogen.

00:22:25.018 --> 00:22:28.118
Burke, I need that wolf.
Dead or alive.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.922
<i>Copy that.</i>

00:22:33.158 --> 00:22:36.629
This is the list of the unrecognized
hybrids you were talking about.

00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:41.366
George's lab results are in.

00:22:41.368 --> 00:22:43.036
You're not gonna like 'em.

00:22:46.106 --> 00:22:47.971
This can't be right.

00:22:47.973 --> 00:22:50.275
His neuromuscular synapse
activity is through the roof,

00:22:50.277 --> 00:22:54.010
his blood has lethal
concentrations of growth hormone,

00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:55.480
he'd be dead.

00:22:55.482 --> 00:22:56.646
Run it again.

00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:58.317
I did.

00:22:58.319 --> 00:23:01.118
I ran it three times.
His values went up each time.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.787
We can't keep this quiet.

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:04.689
Animal Response is
asking questions.

00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:06.325
I just dodged a call. It was
someone from the government.

00:23:06.327 --> 00:23:07.791
What do you want me to tell
people?

00:23:07.793 --> 00:23:09.626
Tell them nothing.

00:23:09.628 --> 00:23:10.894
He didn't do it, Nelson.

00:23:10.896 --> 00:23:12.364
Look at him.
Somebody did that to him.

00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:15.532
Davis, he killed
a grizzly bear.

00:23:15.534 --> 00:23:17.801
Okay? Snapped his neck
like it was a toothpick.

00:23:17.803 --> 00:23:20.637
Listen, protocol says, first sign of
aggression mandates immediate isolation.

00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:21.873
It's what we're doing.

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.174
This is beyond protocol.

00:23:24.176 --> 00:23:26.411
Davis, look at him.

00:23:26.413 --> 00:23:28.682
- I'm looking at him.
- Really look at him!

00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:33.687
That is not the George we know.

00:23:37.557 --> 00:23:39.426
If we report this,
they're gonna put him down.

00:23:42.194 --> 00:23:44.098
I can't let that happen.

00:23:50.337 --> 00:23:52.936
I'll keep everyone off your
back as long as I can.

00:23:52.938 --> 00:23:54.107
All right.

00:23:54.907 --> 00:23:56.042
Thank you.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.796
I'm gonna figure this out,
George.

00:24:19.898 --> 00:24:21.201
I promise.

00:24:25.871 --> 00:24:28.038
All right, everybody,
listen up.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.474
I need to find someone who knows
exactly what the hell this thing is.

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:32.977
I found her!

00:24:32.979 --> 00:24:34.979
No, that's a lie.
Technically, she found us.

00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:37.114
You must be Davis Okoye.

00:24:37.116 --> 00:24:39.616
Thank you so much for
your help.

00:24:39.618 --> 00:24:41.319
What help?

00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:43.820
I'm Kate Caldwell. I'm a
geneticist with Energyne.

00:24:43.822 --> 00:24:46.490
Um, you recovered
my research sample.

00:24:46.492 --> 00:24:48.593
Yeah, you mean this?

00:24:48.595 --> 00:24:51.729
Oh, please tell me you had that
tested for residual particulates.

00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:54.097
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
I always do that.

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:55.665
Anytime something
new comes in.

00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.602
Amy, have this tested
for residual particulates.

00:24:57.604 --> 00:24:59.069
I need that back.

00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:01.505
Actually, I need some
questions answered.

00:25:01.507 --> 00:25:04.308
Like what the hell is that
thing doing to my friend?

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.112
Uh, well, I am not allowed
to discuss that with you.

00:25:08.114 --> 00:25:10.580
Oh. Okay, well,

00:25:10.582 --> 00:25:12.583
I guess we can't help each
other then.

00:25:12.585 --> 00:25:14.751
Kate Caldwell, it was good to meet you.
Nelson, show her out.

00:25:14.753 --> 00:25:16.088
He's growing, isn't he?

00:25:17.589 --> 00:25:20.090
At an unprecedented rate,
right?

00:25:20.092 --> 00:25:24.127
Increased strength, speed,
agility.

00:25:24.129 --> 00:25:27.867
Demonstrating levels of aggression
you don't see in his species.

00:25:31.204 --> 00:25:32.705
Come with me.

00:25:39.145 --> 00:25:41.444
Last night, he was seven feet,
500 pounds.

00:25:41.446 --> 00:25:44.218
This morning, he was almost
nine feet, pushing 1,000.

00:25:45.984 --> 00:25:47.484
His hair?

00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:49.452
Yeah, he's an albino.

00:25:49.454 --> 00:25:51.774
As far as I know, he's the only
living gorilla of his kind.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.460
He can sign?

00:25:56.462 --> 00:25:57.862
Yeah, he can sign
and he's hungry.

00:25:57.864 --> 00:25:59.462
Guys, let's get George
something to eat.

00:25:59.464 --> 00:26:01.635
It's okay.
There you go, buddy.

00:26:02.835 --> 00:26:04.535
It makes sense.

00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:05.869
He must be starving.

00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:07.805
He's growing so rapidly.

00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:09.340
"Makes sense"?

00:26:09.342 --> 00:26:11.041
Last night, he killed
a grizzly bear.

00:26:11.043 --> 00:26:12.977
The most powerful terrestrial
predator on the planet.

00:26:12.979 --> 00:26:15.512
So you tell me right now, Kate,
how any of this makes sense.

00:26:15.514 --> 00:26:17.348
Are you familiar with CRISPR?

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.649
Yeah, genetic engineering.

00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:20.318
It's more like
genetic editing.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.321
I am talking about
extremely specific results.

00:26:23.323 --> 00:26:25.021
Check this out.

00:26:25.023 --> 00:26:27.525
Sharks are indeterminate
growers, right?

00:26:27.527 --> 00:26:28.858
They never stop.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.028
Isolate that gene
and combine it with, say,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.029
the growth rate of a
blue whale,

00:26:33.031 --> 00:26:34.865
the strength of a
rhinoceros beetle,

00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:36.834
the speed of a cheetah,

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:39.270
And you get one confused gorilla
that could take down a grizzly.

00:26:39.272 --> 00:26:42.206
We developed a lot of different
genetic combinations,

00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:45.608
so changes will be incredibly
unpredictable.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.577
<i>Right. Okay,
Kate, I get all that,</i>

00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:49.747
but it still doesn't explain
to me how he doubled in size.

00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:51.449
Guys, we need to get that
food in now.

00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:53.951
See, CRISPR only allows
you to alter

00:26:53.953 --> 00:26:56.253
the DNA of one cell at a time.

00:26:56.255 --> 00:26:58.423
But I developed a system

00:26:58.425 --> 00:27:03.626
which rapidly transmits changes to every
strand of DNA in the host's body.

00:27:03.628 --> 00:27:05.762
Mr. Okoye, listen to me.

00:27:05.764 --> 00:27:09.066
I am the only one
who can cure him.

00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:12.438
George!

00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:17.577
George! No!

00:27:24.617 --> 00:27:25.786
It's not gonna hold.

00:27:26.452 --> 00:27:27.453
Kate!

00:27:31.723 --> 00:27:33.159
Everybody back!

00:27:42.835 --> 00:27:44.838
Not again! Not again!

00:27:46.606 --> 00:27:48.172
George!

00:27:48.174 --> 00:27:50.807
George! Stop, George!

00:27:50.809 --> 00:27:51.811
<i>Davis!</i>

00:27:53.512 --> 00:27:55.312
Shit.
Call 911!

00:27:55.314 --> 00:27:56.615
Come on!

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.150
Look out!

00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:19.702
George! George!

00:28:19.704 --> 00:28:21.939
George, it's okay.
It's okay.

00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:23.473
It's okay.

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:26.042
Yes, I know you're scared.
I'm gonna help you.

00:28:29.648 --> 00:28:30.883
No, no, no.

00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:34.184
No, it's okay.

00:28:34.186 --> 00:28:35.553
Sir, move away from the
animal!

00:28:35.555 --> 00:28:37.289
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.856
I'm the primatologist here.
I look after this animal.

00:28:39.858 --> 00:28:42.795
I can handle this situation. I just
need you to lower your weapons.

00:28:43.362 --> 00:28:44.364
Please.

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.202
It's okay. Calm.

00:28:49.868 --> 00:28:51.003
Good.

00:28:54.573 --> 00:28:55.708
Stand down.

00:28:57.009 --> 00:28:58.145
Stand down.

00:28:59.544 --> 00:29:01.814
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna help you.

00:29:05.518 --> 00:29:06.586
What the hell?

00:29:09.388 --> 00:29:10.390
No!

00:29:15.094 --> 00:29:16.230
George!

00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.123
George!

00:29:43.723 --> 00:29:45.090
George!

00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:47.794
George!

00:29:58.471 --> 00:30:01.605
<i>I've never hunted a wolf before.
What do you think, fellas?</i>

00:30:01.607 --> 00:30:03.443
<i>Should I bring the .50 cal?</i>

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.813
<i>Got 'em.
Treeline.</i>

00:30:10.081 --> 00:30:13.318
<i>You sure that's a wolf?
Damn, that thing is moving.</i>

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.820
<i>Not for long.</i>

00:30:32.938 --> 00:30:34.306
<i>Burke to Base,</i>

00:30:34.308 --> 00:30:36.809
<i>Rampage-1 is down.</i>

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:15.347
What do you got?

00:31:15.349 --> 00:31:17.149
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

00:31:19.484 --> 00:31:20.986
Wait a second.

00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:25.455
<i>We got tracks.</i>

00:31:25.457 --> 00:31:26.992
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:34.568
Jesus.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.002
A wolf made that?

00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:41.375
Maybe I should've
brought the .50 cal.

00:31:57.056 --> 00:31:58.358
Boss...

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.494
How we playing this?

00:32:04.496 --> 00:32:05.831
Nice and easy.

00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:17.241
They're in a hurry.

00:32:17.243 --> 00:32:18.378
What do you think spooked...

00:32:20.613 --> 00:32:22.846
Vinny! Garrick!
Set a perimeter!

00:32:22.848 --> 00:32:24.448
- Come on!
- Open fire!

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.384
<i>Get it! Get it!</i>

00:32:26.386 --> 00:32:27.621
<i>Light him up!</i>

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.855
What the hell?

00:32:32.857 --> 00:32:34.057
<i>Hit 'em! Hit 'em!</i>

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:36.026
<i>Run! Run!</i>

00:32:36.028 --> 00:32:37.560
<i>Garrick, where are you?</i>

00:32:37.562 --> 00:32:39.898
<i>- It's on me!
- Run, Garrick!</i>

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:42.633
Come on, get it!

00:32:42.635 --> 00:32:43.967
<i>Taylor, get up!</i>

00:32:43.969 --> 00:32:45.068
They won't.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.636
<i>Taylor! Go!</i>

00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:48.806
The pathogen is doing what
we designed it to.

00:32:48.808 --> 00:32:50.609
<i>No! God damn it!</i>

00:32:56.383 --> 00:32:58.084
Wilson, check in.

00:32:58.951 --> 00:33:00.587
Zammit, check in.

00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:03.957
Taylor...

00:33:31.983 --> 00:33:33.283
Garcia, get me outta here.

00:33:33.285 --> 00:33:34.687
<i>Copy that. Ten klicks out.</i>

00:33:44.696 --> 00:33:46.930
<i>Oh, shit! I see him!</i>

00:33:46.932 --> 00:33:48.635
Light him up!

00:33:53.973 --> 00:33:55.841
Incoming!

00:33:58.377 --> 00:34:00.009
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

00:34:00.011 --> 00:34:02.011
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:34:02.013 --> 00:34:04.050
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:02.008
Sir, let's go.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.348
Out of the van, please.

00:35:21.526 --> 00:35:23.028
Who the hell is this?

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:35.642
Mr. Okoye and Dr. Caldwell.

00:35:36.908 --> 00:35:39.609
I am Agent Harvey Russell.

00:35:39.611 --> 00:35:41.444
Hell of a day, huh?

00:35:41.446 --> 00:35:44.215
Science experiments
falling from the sky.

00:35:44.217 --> 00:35:46.416
Giant gorilla on the loose.

00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:49.553
Just the kind of exciting shit we here
at the government tend to notice.

00:35:49.555 --> 00:35:51.988
Where's George? I need to
see him.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.957
And if you're thinking about putting him on
that plane, it's gonna be a big mistake.

00:35:54.959 --> 00:35:56.662
I think we'll be all right.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.765
Okay, let's all take a
breath and...

00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:03.834
I said I wanna see George.

00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:07.004
Or we can get in each other's
faces and see who's the toughest.

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:09.805
Brother, I'm gonna prance
myself right out on a limb,

00:36:09.807 --> 00:36:13.776
and guess that no one's ever accused
you of being a people person.

00:36:13.778 --> 00:36:17.915
How about you take these cuffs
off and find out yourself?

00:36:17.917 --> 00:36:19.185
Brother.

00:36:23.422 --> 00:36:25.022
I'll see you on board.

00:36:25.024 --> 00:36:27.026
Load 'em up with the ape.

00:36:28.693 --> 00:36:31.264
So weird that he didn't take
your cuffs off.

00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:46.011
- He's good.
- All right.

00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:49.448
Just note it in the chart.

00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:53.116
You see that?

00:36:53.118 --> 00:36:56.053
Where he cut himself breaking
out of the primate department.

00:36:56.055 --> 00:36:57.988
There's barely a bruise now.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.823
African spiny mouse.

00:37:00.825 --> 00:37:04.696
Its DNA makes it capable
of extreme regeneration.

00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:10.566
"Davis Okoye,
Primate Specialist."

00:37:10.568 --> 00:37:12.238
Blah, blah, blah.

00:37:14.506 --> 00:37:16.573
Army Special Forces.

00:37:16.575 --> 00:37:19.176
What are you, some kind of
international man of mystery?

00:37:19.178 --> 00:37:23.714
I see a lot of "redacted."
"Redacted, redacted..."

00:37:23.716 --> 00:37:25.881
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

00:37:25.883 --> 00:37:29.919
"Transferred to the United Nations'
Special Anti-Poaching Task Force."

00:37:29.921 --> 00:37:32.522
Well, I'll have you know that I,
myself, am also an animal lover.

00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:34.191
Let's cut the bullshit,
Russell.

00:37:34.193 --> 00:37:36.026
I told you, having George
on this airplane is suicidal.

00:37:36.028 --> 00:37:37.894
He's on a very powerful
sedative drip.

00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:41.031
He will not wake up until we
wake him up.

00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:44.000
Sir, with all due respect,
at his rate of growth,

00:37:44.002 --> 00:37:47.371
that sedative is gonna become ineffective
long before we're back on the ground.

00:37:47.373 --> 00:37:50.407
We factored in his growth rate.
Same as his elevated metabolism.

00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:52.409
- Sir.
- And the increased amount of blood,

00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:55.678
in his system. We may not be the
brightest bulbs in the room,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.613
but we're doing all right.

00:37:57.615 --> 00:37:59.950
<i>Especially considering,</i>

00:37:59.952 --> 00:38:03.020
you got another one of your little science
experiments running around out there.

00:38:03.022 --> 00:38:04.453
What do you mean another one?

00:38:04.455 --> 00:38:06.622
Oh, you didn't know about
the 30-foot wolf?

00:38:06.624 --> 00:38:08.924
Oh, sir,

00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:11.930
your oversized monkey
is old news.

00:38:13.064 --> 00:38:14.698
Jesus.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.302
Weirdos on the Internet
are calling him "Ralph."

00:38:18.304 --> 00:38:19.870
Who do you work for?

00:38:19.872 --> 00:38:21.872
Sir, I work for the American
people.

00:38:21.874 --> 00:38:23.443
Homeland? CIA?

00:38:24.977 --> 00:38:27.076
Justice League?

00:38:27.078 --> 00:38:28.979
I'm OGA.

00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:31.982
I've heard that bullshit before.
"Other Government Agency," huh?

00:38:31.984 --> 00:38:33.149
It's clever.

00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:35.219
Yes, sir, it is clever.

00:38:35.221 --> 00:38:38.221
You see, when science
shits the bed,

00:38:38.223 --> 00:38:40.557
I'm the guy they call
to change the sheets.

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:42.591
What's gonna happen to George?

00:38:42.593 --> 00:38:44.961
He didn't ask for any of this. He
sure as hell doesn't deserve it.

00:38:44.963 --> 00:38:48.932
Whether it is his fault or
not, he is dangerous.

00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:51.402
But there's a cure for this.

00:38:51.404 --> 00:38:53.904
She helped engineer the
pathogen that infected George.

00:38:53.906 --> 00:38:56.306
She works for Energyne.

00:38:56.308 --> 00:38:58.443
You mean used to.

00:39:05.017 --> 00:39:08.919
"Dr. Kate Caldwell. Ph.D. in
Biochemistry from Stanford,

00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.854
"with a specialty
in Conservation Genetics."

00:39:11.856 --> 00:39:15.694
Recruited by Energyne in 2010.

00:39:17.428 --> 00:39:19.629
Fired by Energyne,

00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:21.533
<i>a little less than two
years ago.</i>

00:39:22.335 --> 00:39:23.966
It gets better.

00:39:23.968 --> 00:39:26.970
Caught trying to steal
company hard drives,

00:39:26.972 --> 00:39:29.273
and did 13, what I'm sure
were glorious months,

00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:33.313
in our beautiful Greenville
Federal Correctional Institute.

00:39:36.147 --> 00:39:41.183
Well, I am guessing by the
look on the big fella's face

00:39:41.185 --> 00:39:42.854
that this is all news to him.

00:39:44.689 --> 00:39:47.957
Enjoy your flight.

00:39:47.959 --> 00:39:51.397
Oh. Mr. Okoye,
about your friend.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.633
For what it's worth,

00:39:55.968 --> 00:39:58.071
I am truly sorry.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.317
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:40:12.984 --> 00:40:15.185
Can you cure George or not?

00:40:15.187 --> 00:40:18.087
I know that Energyne was working on
a counter-measure to the pathogen,

00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:19.658
Yes or no?

00:40:23.162 --> 00:40:24.763
No.

00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:36.772
<i>Claire, I found him.</i>

00:40:36.774 --> 00:40:38.741
Some black ops-looking dudes
loaded the gorilla,

00:40:38.743 --> 00:40:42.745
into a cargo plane late last night.
You know who that is with them?

00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:45.048
No. But clearly, he likes
hitting the gym.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.551
No. The woman.

00:40:48.353 --> 00:40:50.122
It's Kate Caldwell.

00:40:50.856 --> 00:40:52.589
Dr. Caldwell.

00:40:52.591 --> 00:40:55.591
Yeah. What's she doing
out there?

00:40:55.593 --> 00:40:58.861
Well, given our history
with her,

00:40:58.863 --> 00:41:02.866
her blaming us for putting her in
prison and the death of her brother,

00:41:02.868 --> 00:41:07.102
my best guess? Gathering
evidence to screw us over.

00:41:07.104 --> 00:41:09.705
I told you, we should've
liquidated her two years ago.

00:41:09.707 --> 00:41:11.908
Claire, you can't liquidate
every problem you have.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.277
Agree to disagree.

00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:15.611
Claire, I'm serious! Hey!

00:41:15.613 --> 00:41:17.280
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

00:41:17.282 --> 00:41:19.282
but I don't even care
about the money anymore, okay?

00:41:19.284 --> 00:41:20.750
I just don't want
to go to prison.

00:41:20.752 --> 00:41:23.118
So if you have a plan,
I would love to hear it.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.992
Brett, I always have a plan.

00:41:30.629 --> 00:41:34.096
If you've given a subject
extraordinary genetic gifts,

00:41:34.098 --> 00:41:36.933
and unlimited physical potential
combined with unthinkable violent,

00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:39.769
and aggressive disposition,
how do you control it?

00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:41.937
I don't know,
you give it a chill pill or...

00:41:41.939 --> 00:41:44.107
Yes. See?
That wasn't so hard.

00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:45.575
Yes!

00:41:45.577 --> 00:41:48.411
R-19, the chill pill.
One small dose will stop

00:41:48.413 --> 00:41:50.680
an infected creature's
growth and aggression.

00:41:50.682 --> 00:41:54.618
And to draw them here, the pathogen
also genetically rewired the subject

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.187
to respond to a low
frequency radio wave.

00:41:57.189 --> 00:41:59.455
Lucky for us,

00:41:59.457 --> 00:42:02.293
this building has some of the most
powerful radio antennas in the world.

00:42:02.295 --> 00:42:05.264
I had our team modify
this one last night.

00:42:16.342 --> 00:42:18.674
Now, we just have to
turn on the signal.

00:42:18.676 --> 00:42:20.944
And those creatures will
do anything to get here

00:42:20.946 --> 00:42:22.544
and make it stop.

00:42:22.546 --> 00:42:25.147
How do you think that will
go over at 32,000 feet?

00:42:25.149 --> 00:42:27.183
That monkey will bring the
whole plane down.

00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:29.551
And when the wolf gets here,
we let the military kill it,

00:42:29.553 --> 00:42:32.187
and then we collect a sample
of the weaponized DNA.

00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:34.293
Then we sell that shit
for a mint!

00:42:39.897 --> 00:42:41.368
Wow.

00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:37.689
George, you okay, buddy?

00:43:55.807 --> 00:43:57.411
Oh, no.

00:44:03.749 --> 00:44:05.117
Get up. Now!

00:44:10.921 --> 00:44:13.259
<i>Caution. Caution. Caution.</i>

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:21.830
Aim for his body!

00:44:21.832 --> 00:44:23.135
Light him up!

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.638
Get back!

00:44:41.486 --> 00:44:42.852
Come on, come on!

00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:43.989
Strap in.

00:45:00.504 --> 00:45:02.274
6-1-2-Heavy,
mayday, mayday!

00:45:06.778 --> 00:45:08.215
Shit. Shit.

00:45:26.832 --> 00:45:28.134
George.

00:45:52.257 --> 00:45:53.525
Oh, shit!

00:46:22.953 --> 00:46:23.955
Hold on!

00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:31.463
Davis!

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.299
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:46:45.609 --> 00:46:47.109
Davis!

00:46:47.111 --> 00:46:48.546
Swing me!

00:47:04.129 --> 00:47:05.265
Now what?

00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:14.607
We're getting the hell off
this plane!

00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:28.355
Hang on tight!

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.968
This is insane!
We're gonna die!

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.202
Probably!

00:47:46.204 --> 00:47:47.506
Now go!

00:48:15.368 --> 00:48:16.402
God damn it, Russell!

00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:35.852
Holy shit!

00:48:35.854 --> 00:48:37.489
You're welcome!

00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:01.348
I'm sorry, George.

00:49:30.475 --> 00:49:32.144
Where's the body?

00:49:39.384 --> 00:49:40.985
There isn't one.

00:49:42.886 --> 00:49:44.890
He's wounded but he survived.

00:49:48.226 --> 00:49:49.827
Tracks are headed northeast.

00:49:50.894 --> 00:49:52.627
And I got zero signal.

00:49:52.629 --> 00:49:55.163
I'm gonna see if I can find
a radio, get it working.

00:49:55.165 --> 00:49:59.402
Once DoD figures out your
animal survived that crash,

00:49:59.404 --> 00:50:01.304
they're gonna have questions
for you two.

00:50:01.306 --> 00:50:03.138
What about Energyne?

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.475
They know a hell of a lot more
about this than we do.

00:50:05.477 --> 00:50:08.244
Yeah, the FBI's checking on
Energyne.

00:50:08.246 --> 00:50:09.847
Listen, do me a favor,

00:50:10.981 --> 00:50:13.017
don't meander off too far.

00:50:14.151 --> 00:50:16.185
Oh, Mr. Okoye.

00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:18.754
Yeah.

00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:22.291
Thank you for getting this
old cowboy off that plane.

00:50:22.293 --> 00:50:24.495
Well, even assholes deserve
a second chance.

00:50:27.031 --> 00:50:29.799
Like my grandpappy
always said,

00:50:29.801 --> 00:50:32.104
us assholes gotta stick
together.

00:50:35.807 --> 00:50:37.774
Have you seen our
satellite footage?

00:50:37.776 --> 00:50:39.478
The gorilla survived
the crash!

00:50:40.279 --> 00:50:42.611
Yes.

00:50:42.613 --> 00:50:45.215
Unfortunately,
so did Dr. Caldwell.

00:50:45.217 --> 00:50:47.051
So now what?

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.120
The gorilla doesn't
concern me.

00:50:51.122 --> 00:50:53.855
It'll respond to the radio
frequency and come straight to us.

00:50:53.857 --> 00:50:56.293
Dr. Caldwell is the bigger
problem.

00:50:56.295 --> 00:50:57.963
Do you think she told them
something?

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:04.333
Based on the federal agents who are
about to walk through our door,

00:51:04.335 --> 00:51:06.836
I'd say she told them
everything.

00:51:06.838 --> 00:51:07.973
What?

00:51:15.747 --> 00:51:17.213
Ah...

00:51:17.215 --> 00:51:19.215
Claire Wyden.
How may I be of assistance?

00:51:19.217 --> 00:51:21.183
Agent Park, FBI.

00:51:21.185 --> 00:51:23.685
This is a warrant for a complete
search of your company's records,

00:51:23.687 --> 00:51:25.187
starting with your lab.

00:51:25.189 --> 00:51:27.024
Of course. Follow me.

00:51:31.763 --> 00:51:34.897
We are horrified that what's happening
out there originated in this lab,

00:51:34.899 --> 00:51:37.201
and we will do anything we
can to help.

00:51:37.203 --> 00:51:39.502
Good, we need access to
everything.

00:51:39.504 --> 00:51:42.171
Absolutely.
You have our full cooperation.

00:51:42.173 --> 00:51:43.506
Every file.

00:51:43.508 --> 00:51:46.908
Hard drives and servers, too.
Let's go.

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.845
Step away from
your work station, sir.

00:51:48.847 --> 00:51:51.248
Could you open that up?
Keep yourself logged in.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.049
Step back.

00:51:53.051 --> 00:51:55.183
To that end, Agent Park, we're
going through the files

00:51:55.185 --> 00:51:58.355
of the scientist responsible for
these creatures, Dr. Kate Caldwell.

00:51:58.357 --> 00:52:01.122
I'm sure you're aware
of her criminal record.

00:52:01.124 --> 00:52:03.226
Unfortunately,
we're just now uncovering

00:52:03.228 --> 00:52:06.428
all the horrible things she was
doing during her time here.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:08.364
I'll need that list of
Energyne servers, ASAP.

00:52:08.366 --> 00:52:09.634
Of course, sir.

00:52:16.908 --> 00:52:17.910
You okay?

00:52:19.277 --> 00:52:21.776
Because you're sweating.
A lot.

00:52:21.778 --> 00:52:23.044
No, I'm fine.

00:52:23.046 --> 00:52:24.982
Everything's fine.

00:52:27.386 --> 00:52:29.886
Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,

00:52:29.888 --> 00:52:33.322
this is Echo-Four-Romeo, over.

00:52:33.324 --> 00:52:36.491
<i>Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,</i>

00:52:36.493 --> 00:52:38.995
<i>this is Echo-Four-Romeo.</i>

00:52:38.997 --> 00:52:41.433
So, what do we do now?

00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:45.567
I'm sorry, Doc.

00:52:45.569 --> 00:52:47.569
There's no "we" anymore.

00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:51.439
Look, I am sorry
I lied to you.

00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:53.342
Yeah, save it.

00:52:53.344 --> 00:52:55.944
You wanted something, you lied to get it.
You're human.

00:52:55.946 --> 00:52:58.149
What makes you dislike
people so much?

00:53:03.955 --> 00:53:05.787
Let me tell you something.

00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:08.591
I've fought in wars all
over the world.

00:53:08.593 --> 00:53:12.861
Hunted down animal poachers,
Africa, India, South America.

00:53:12.863 --> 00:53:16.165
I got to see how people
really are.

00:53:16.167 --> 00:53:18.703
And they'll pretty much do
anything to get what they want.

00:53:20.437 --> 00:53:22.441
You think we're all like that?

00:53:24.441 --> 00:53:26.345
You know where I found George?

00:53:28.313 --> 00:53:30.648
<i>He was hiding underneath
the poacher's truck.</i>

00:53:33.284 --> 00:53:35.351
<i>When my team arrived,</i>

00:53:35.353 --> 00:53:39.288
<i>these bastards were in the
middle of butchering his mother.</i>

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:43.792
<i>They were cutting off her hands so
they could sell them as ashtrays.</i>

00:53:43.794 --> 00:53:45.995
<i>George never would've survived
on his own.</i>

00:53:45.997 --> 00:53:49.067
<i>An albino like that on the black
market is worth a fortune.</i>

00:53:50.369 --> 00:53:52.170
So I took him with me.

00:53:55.138 --> 00:53:56.908
And what happened
to the poachers?

00:53:58.377 --> 00:54:01.680
Well, they shot at us
and they missed.

00:54:02.479 --> 00:54:04.015
I shot back.

00:54:04.749 --> 00:54:05.884
I didn't.

00:54:33.212 --> 00:54:36.781
It's a good thing George doesn't
feel the same way about people.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.284
What's that supposed to mean?

00:54:41.286 --> 00:54:43.387
Oh. After what happened
to his family,

00:54:43.389 --> 00:54:46.058
it feels like it would be real
easy for him not to trust humans,

00:54:47.725 --> 00:54:49.627
but he definitely trusts you.

00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:53.095
Right?

00:54:53.097 --> 00:54:55.631
You're a geneticist,
you're not a shrink.

00:54:55.633 --> 00:54:59.901
I also have a Ph.D. in calling
people on their shit.

00:54:59.903 --> 00:55:02.937
Ah, well.
This ought to be good then.

00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:06.441
Look, after college,
I was using CRISPR

00:55:06.443 --> 00:55:08.779
to help endangered species
in the Arctic.

00:55:09.981 --> 00:55:12.881
Then my brother got sick.

00:55:12.883 --> 00:55:15.884
Doctors told him he didn't
have much of a chance.

00:55:15.886 --> 00:55:17.589
But I knew CRISPR
could save him.

00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:22.259
Then Claire Wyden showed up.

00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:25.593
She made me her lead
genetic researcher.

00:55:25.595 --> 00:55:28.264
- So Energyne recruited you?
- Yeah.

00:55:28.266 --> 00:55:30.300
But what I didn't
know was that

00:55:30.302 --> 00:55:32.167
every time I'd make a breakthrough
that could help my brother,

00:55:32.169 --> 00:55:34.939
they were secretly using it
to build weaponized DNA.

00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:39.477
I tried to destroy it.

00:55:41.111 --> 00:55:43.848
Security just got to me
before I could finish the job.

00:55:46.517 --> 00:55:49.286
Anyway, uh,

00:55:49.288 --> 00:55:52.491
a month after I went
to prison, my brother died.

00:55:56.861 --> 00:55:59.196
I never even got to say
goodbye.

00:56:02.667 --> 00:56:03.935
I'm sorry.

00:56:05.337 --> 00:56:07.169
I just wanna make sure

00:56:07.171 --> 00:56:10.809
the Wydens can't hurt anyone
or anything ever again.

00:56:13.044 --> 00:56:14.713
Does that sound like a plan?

00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:18.283
Sounds like a plan.

00:56:24.888 --> 00:56:27.124
Looks like our ride's here.

00:56:38.169 --> 00:56:40.739
<i>...Captain Evans.</i>

00:56:44.342 --> 00:56:46.242
<i>Copy that.
Set a perimeter.</i>

00:56:50.714 --> 00:56:52.982
Colonel Blake, sir.

00:56:52.984 --> 00:56:55.351
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we have
eyes on targets Alpha and Bravo.</i>

00:56:55.353 --> 00:56:58.420
Roger that. Get in
position to box them in.

00:56:58.422 --> 00:57:00.022
<i>Roger, Six-Actual.</i>

00:57:00.024 --> 00:57:01.924
<i>Targets are eight klicks out
and moving fast.</i>

00:57:01.926 --> 00:57:03.528
George is with the wolf?

00:57:05.162 --> 00:57:06.729
You've engaged the
gorilla, sir?

00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.696
And the wolf.

00:57:08.698 --> 00:57:11.000
Got them surrounded in a quarry
about 30 miles outside Chicago.

00:57:11.002 --> 00:57:14.537
Their trajectories had them both going
in a straight line to the city.

00:57:14.539 --> 00:57:17.038
Two different species making a
coordinated long-distance journey.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.439
That just doesn't happen.

00:57:18.441 --> 00:57:19.607
Excuse me. Who is this?

00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:21.544
Colonel, this is Davis Okoye.

00:57:21.546 --> 00:57:24.046
He's a primatologist.
He raised the gorilla there.

00:57:24.048 --> 00:57:26.881
And that is Dr. Caldwell.
She worked for Energyne.

00:57:26.883 --> 00:57:29.118
She helped cook up
our cuddly little friends.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.053
Agent Russell, this is a
military operation.

00:57:31.055 --> 00:57:34.723
Yes, sir. I understand that, sir.
But right now,

00:57:34.725 --> 00:57:37.959
these two know more about these
creatures than anyone on this planet.

00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:40.796
I think you need to hear
what they have to say.

00:57:40.798 --> 00:57:43.098
<i>Colonel, what everybody
has to understand is</i>

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.600
this is no longer just a wolf
and a gorilla.

00:57:45.602 --> 00:57:47.803
A wolf and a gorilla would
be attacking each other.

00:57:47.805 --> 00:57:50.939
They wouldn't be traveling in a
straight line to the same destination.

00:57:50.941 --> 00:57:53.042
Then what are they doing and
why are they going to Chicago?

00:57:53.044 --> 00:57:55.044
Because they're being called.

00:57:55.046 --> 00:57:57.879
When I was at Energyne,
we worked with bat DNA.

00:57:57.881 --> 00:58:01.251
The Wydens were obsessed with
developing biosonar communication,

00:58:01.253 --> 00:58:03.886
<i>and it looks like they got it
to work.</i>

00:58:03.888 --> 00:58:07.324
Energyne must be emitting some
kind of signal to draw them there.

00:58:07.326 --> 00:58:09.991
Those creatures will do
anything

00:58:09.993 --> 00:58:13.428
to get to that signal and
make it stop.

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.798
Colonel, you have to
evacuate Chicago.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.799
These creatures are engineered
to regenerate.

00:58:17.801 --> 00:58:19.468
<i>Bullets and tanks
are not gonna stop them.</i>

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:22.275
We have our contingencies
in order, Mr. Okoye.

00:58:23.241 --> 00:58:24.475
Colonel.

00:58:28.178 --> 00:58:31.913
In the meantime, the FBI has
requested that you remain here.

00:58:31.915 --> 00:58:34.116
They have a few questions
of their own.

00:58:34.118 --> 00:58:35.618
These gentlemen will
see you out.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.821
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Come on.

00:58:38.257 --> 00:58:39.754
You're making a big
mistake, Colonel.

00:58:39.756 --> 00:58:42.191
Sir, let's go.

00:58:42.193 --> 00:58:44.859
<i>Targets in circle. All
Bushmasters, targets in three kill zone.</i>

00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:46.861
<i>Hold fire till playtime.</i>

00:58:46.863 --> 00:58:49.266
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we
have the targets surrounded.</i>

00:58:49.268 --> 00:58:52.335
<i>Ambush is set.
All Bushmasters standing by.</i>

00:58:52.337 --> 00:58:53.705
Prepare to engage.

00:58:58.642 --> 00:59:02.214
This operation is gonna go south fast.
We have to get to Chicago.

00:59:04.147 --> 00:59:06.649
Yeah, I'm working on it.

00:59:06.651 --> 00:59:09.017
All right, you two. We're in
the transport to the left.

00:59:09.019 --> 00:59:11.188
- Kate, come on, come on.
- Hey! Hey!

00:59:11.955 --> 00:59:13.389
Hey, I said left.

00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:14.990
Okay. Hold on a second, boys.

00:59:14.992 --> 00:59:17.125
You look like very smart MPs.

00:59:17.127 --> 00:59:19.627
You also know there's a lot of bad
shit that's going on right now.

00:59:19.629 --> 00:59:21.230
And I gotta be honest with
you both,

00:59:21.232 --> 00:59:24.033
this stuff that we're doing?
It's not working for me.

00:59:24.035 --> 00:59:25.834
- Enough. Move!
- Okay, all right.

00:59:25.836 --> 00:59:27.304
Just consider this.

00:59:27.306 --> 00:59:29.470
I'm a former team guy.
Let's not do this thing,

00:59:29.472 --> 00:59:31.540
where you get in my face,
you threaten me,

00:59:31.542 --> 00:59:33.508
because I'm gonna have
to knock you out,

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:35.378
and then, you, look at me. I'm
gonna choke you out so bad,

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:38.213
you're gonna urinate yourself,
and in front of the lady.

00:59:38.215 --> 00:59:40.515
- It's not a good look.
- It wasn't a goddamn request!

00:59:40.517 --> 00:59:42.186
- Let's go!
- Hey!

00:59:47.992 --> 00:59:50.892
This is exactly what I
didn't want to happen.

00:59:50.894 --> 00:59:53.162
That's a big arm.
Don't fight it.

00:59:53.164 --> 00:59:55.064
Don't fight it.

00:59:55.066 --> 00:59:57.435
There you go. Sleepy time.

01:00:01.906 --> 01:00:03.738
That's the plan you
were working on?

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.874
Well, I didn't kill them.

01:00:11.515 --> 01:00:13.115
So what are we looking for?

01:00:13.117 --> 01:00:15.116
<i>We're looking
for a helicopter,</i>

01:00:15.118 --> 01:00:17.086
<i>but preferably one that's not
surrounded by military personnel.</i>

01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:19.591
They probably have a grounded
medevac chopper at the hospital.

01:00:23.395 --> 01:00:25.430
And that's why you always
bring a doctor.

01:00:51.255 --> 01:00:52.557
Good job, Doc.

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.662
<i>Well, well, well, looky here.</i>

01:01:00.664 --> 01:01:02.964
Stealing the hospital
whirlybird.

01:01:02.966 --> 01:01:04.799
Color me impressed.

01:01:04.801 --> 01:01:07.102
That is creative.

01:01:07.104 --> 01:01:09.271
Come on. You already saw
what George did to our plane.

01:01:09.273 --> 01:01:11.774
You know everyone's
underestimating these animals.

01:01:11.776 --> 01:01:13.776
But you two have the magic
bullet?

01:01:13.778 --> 01:01:15.144
We think we know
where to find it.

01:01:15.146 --> 01:01:17.313
Listen,

01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:19.448
Claire Wyden is way too smart to
create a weapon she can't control.

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:22.817
They must have an antidote at
Energyne that can halt the mutations.

01:01:22.819 --> 01:01:25.120
If we get our hands on it,
it could be our only shot

01:01:25.122 --> 01:01:27.492
to stop George and the wolf
before they level Chicago.

01:01:32.662 --> 01:01:35.163
You know, this ain't
no truck stop, <i>amigo.</i>

01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:37.602
They don't just leave keys
under the visor.

01:01:38.635 --> 01:01:40.935
Wait, you're helping us?

01:01:40.937 --> 01:01:44.705
You saved my life. I reckon
it's the least I can do.

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:46.774
<i>We're on the same page
when it comes to the Wydens.</i>

01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:49.877
They think they're
above the law.

01:01:49.879 --> 01:01:51.946
And I wanna remind them
that they ain't.

01:01:51.948 --> 01:01:55.616
So yes, we are helping
each other.

01:01:55.618 --> 01:01:56.854
Do what you do.

01:01:58.122 --> 01:01:59.524
I'll be in touch.

01:02:00.624 --> 01:02:02.024
<i>Wow.</i>

01:02:02.026 --> 01:02:04.058
That went way better
than I thought it would.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.127
Yeah, it did. I was hoping I could
knock him out, too, though.

01:02:06.129 --> 01:02:08.663
You know there are other ways
of dealing with people, right?

01:02:08.665 --> 01:02:10.801
I do know that, yeah, but
that's no fun.

01:02:13.337 --> 01:02:14.905
I assume you know how to
fly this thing.

01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:18.810
Absolutely.

01:02:24.682 --> 01:02:26.482
It's coming back to me.

01:02:26.484 --> 01:02:28.819
It's all coming back,
right now.

01:02:30.322 --> 01:02:32.053
Yeah.

01:02:32.055 --> 01:02:37.024
It's coming back.
It's coming back.

01:02:37.026 --> 01:02:40.928
<i>Sir, we are 15 minutes from
sunrise. Call for fire to follow, over.</i>

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.971
<i>We have the targets.
Serpents are in position. It's playtime.</i>

01:02:45.669 --> 01:02:48.102
Get the FLIR footage onscreen.

01:02:48.104 --> 01:02:50.206
<i>FLIR is up.</i>

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.173
<i>This is Three-Six.
Targets in the open, over.</i>

01:02:51.175 --> 01:02:52.342
Clear to fire.

01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:53.745
<i>Shot out.</i>

01:02:59.883 --> 01:03:02.450
<i>Good hit. Stand by for BDA.</i>

01:03:02.452 --> 01:03:04.019
Confirm EKIA.

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:06.555
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Confirm EKIA. Over.</i>

01:03:06.557 --> 01:03:08.457
<i>Roger, Lobo. Stand by.</i>

01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.228
Two-six, stay on overwatch.

01:03:11.928 --> 01:03:14.598
Echo-Zero-two,
moving to phase line gold.

01:03:16.133 --> 01:03:17.266
Jesus!

01:03:17.268 --> 01:03:20.134
Come on, come on.

01:03:20.136 --> 01:03:22.638
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Sitrep, over.</i>

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.373
Negative EKIA.

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:27.475
They must have moved, sir.
I say again, we no longer...

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080
Jesus Christ!

01:03:32.082 --> 01:03:34.253
<i>They're on our east and west flanks!
Everybody move!</i>

01:03:38.322 --> 01:03:39.424
<i>Nothing's working!</i>

01:03:42.459 --> 01:03:45.730
Bushmaster-Six-Alpha, this is Lobo X-ray.
Need a sitrep, over.

01:03:46.597 --> 01:03:47.799
Captain Evans?

01:03:53.604 --> 01:03:57.171
Kaplan, inform the National Guard we're
moving forward with the contingency plan.

01:03:57.173 --> 01:03:59.174
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:03:59.176 --> 01:04:01.642
I want ground artillery rolling
into downtown Chicago, ASAP!

01:04:01.644 --> 01:04:03.678
This time, we throw everything
we can at these things,

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.080
and get people the hell out
of that city!

01:04:06.082 --> 01:04:08.816
<i>I want blockades at every
quarter mile south of the Loop!</i>

01:04:08.818 --> 01:04:10.852
<i>We evacuate
civilians to the north!</i>

01:04:10.854 --> 01:04:14.257
It's me. They are
evacuating Chicago.

01:04:14.259 --> 01:04:16.857
<i>George and the wolf went
right through Blake's men.</i>

01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:19.627
<i>Okoye, they are out in
front of you.</i>

01:04:19.629 --> 01:04:20.765
Copy that.

01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:27.035
What is it?

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:29.278
They're never gonna get everyone
out of the city in time.

01:05:01.206 --> 01:05:02.341
Davis!

01:05:21.557 --> 01:05:23.091
<i>Two-Three,
targets in the open.</i>

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:24.926
<i>Roger. You are clear and hot.</i>

01:05:24.928 --> 01:05:27.662
<i>Roger. Weapons free.
I'm engaging now.</i>

01:05:27.664 --> 01:05:29.364
<i>Jesus!
I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

01:05:29.366 --> 01:05:31.066
<i>Bird down! Bird down!</i>

01:05:31.068 --> 01:05:33.269
<i>To hell with that,
I'm taking these things out.</i>

01:05:33.504 --> 01:05:35.006
<i>I have no control!</i>

01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:45.867
<i>Two-Nine firing, target hit.
Lighting him up.</i>

01:05:50.953 --> 01:05:52.453
<i>He hit me with something!</i>

01:05:52.455 --> 01:05:53.754
<i>Lost tail rudders!</i>

01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:55.760
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going down!</i>

01:06:02.598 --> 01:06:04.899
Status report.
Where is Warthog One?

01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:07.134
Inbound, sir.

01:06:07.136 --> 01:06:09.977
<i>- Warthog One, you are cleared hot.
- Roger that.</i>

01:06:16.613 --> 01:06:18.448
<i>This is Warthog One.
Targets missed.</i>

01:06:20.818 --> 01:06:23.752
<i>Lobo X-ray, request come
back around for another run.</i>

01:06:23.754 --> 01:06:26.955
Warthog One, this is Black-Dog-Six-Actual.
Hit them again.

01:06:26.957 --> 01:06:28.391
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:06:28.393 --> 01:06:29.957
Kaplan, where are we
with the evacuation?

01:06:29.959 --> 01:06:32.395
50% downtown, sir.

01:06:32.397 --> 01:06:35.497
Sir, we have a bogey headed north
in the river, half mile out.

01:06:35.499 --> 01:06:37.402
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:06:44.107 --> 01:06:45.340
Is that a ship?

01:06:45.342 --> 01:06:46.841
It's underwater, sir.

01:06:46.843 --> 01:06:49.179
We don't have any subs
in the area.

01:07:06.763 --> 01:07:09.099
Davis, there's something big
in the river.

01:07:38.995 --> 01:07:40.731
Well, that sucks.

01:07:42.064 --> 01:07:43.732
<i>This is Three-Two.</i>

01:07:43.734 --> 01:07:45.167
<i>We have enemy contact in the river!
How copy?</i>

01:07:45.169 --> 01:07:46.901
<i>Say again, Three-Two?</i>

01:07:46.903 --> 01:07:48.703
<i>Enemy contact!
Target is heading east!</i>

01:07:48.705 --> 01:07:50.471
<i>Copy, Three-Two.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

01:07:50.473 --> 01:07:51.872
1 <i>Negative, negative!
Danger close!</i>

01:07:51.874 --> 01:07:53.140
<i>Copy, Three-Two.</i>

01:07:53.142 --> 01:07:55.912
Direct all forces at that
thing now!

01:07:57.548 --> 01:08:00.515
<i>Enemy contact!
Three o'clock! Engage!</i>

01:08:00.517 --> 01:08:02.384
Flank him!

01:08:02.386 --> 01:08:03.651
Everything you've got!

01:08:03.653 --> 01:08:05.020
Aim for the gills!

01:08:05.022 --> 01:08:06.325
Fire!

01:08:31.547 --> 01:08:33.252
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:08:51.802 --> 01:08:53.202
<i>They can't stop them.</i>

01:08:53.204 --> 01:08:54.872
We gotta get that antidote.

01:09:11.555 --> 01:09:13.322
<i>Alpha-Six-Actual,
we can't hold them!</i>

01:09:13.324 --> 01:09:14.956
<i>I've lost half my men!
We're backing out!</i>

01:09:14.958 --> 01:09:16.925
Are we evacuated downtown?

01:09:16.927 --> 01:09:19.261
Clear at a 10-block radius from
Upper Wacker to Adams, sir.

01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:20.728
Prep the MOABs.

01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:21.932
Roger that.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:35.109
Colonel, you are about to drop the largest
conventional bomb in the arsenal,

01:09:35.111 --> 01:09:37.144
on US soil.

01:09:37.146 --> 01:09:40.447
With all due respect, sir, there
has got to be another way.

01:09:40.449 --> 01:09:42.251
You drop that bomb,

01:09:42.253 --> 01:09:45.687
not only do you wipe out
half a city,

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:47.755
but you'd destroy any
evidence.

01:09:47.757 --> 01:09:50.759
See, I got a team on the way to
Energyne to secure the antidote.

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:55.331
So if you could divert some
resources and support them...

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:58.465
Is this the same team that
stole my medevac chopper?

01:09:58.467 --> 01:10:00.202
Davis Okoye
and Dr. Caldwell...

01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:02.270
Need to get the hell
out of there.

01:10:02.272 --> 01:10:05.105
And I need you to drop
the cowboy bullshit,

01:10:05.107 --> 01:10:06.811
and get with the program.

01:10:10.113 --> 01:10:11.845
Well, sir,

01:10:11.847 --> 01:10:13.848
you know us cowboys.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.551
We just can't stand
leaving our friends behind.

01:10:17.553 --> 01:10:20.288
Get your ass out of here!

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:24.028
Finally, an order of yours
I can agree with.

01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:31.735
Let's bring up a feed
on our stealth bombers.

01:10:34.471 --> 01:10:37.037
Bomber feed is up.

01:10:37.039 --> 01:10:40.376
<i>Viper Two-Five, you've been
released for mission execution, time now.</i>

01:10:40.378 --> 01:10:42.411
<i>Holding
short, runway two-five.</i>

01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:44.246
<i>Cleared for
take-off, runway two-five.</i>

01:10:44.248 --> 01:10:45.880
<i>Cleared for take-off,
two-five.</i>

01:10:45.882 --> 01:10:48.515
<i>Roger. Good luck.</i>

01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:51.386
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

01:10:51.388 --> 01:10:53.421
<i>Package is airborne.</i>

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:56.523
<i>We are inbound.</i>

01:10:56.525 --> 01:10:59.426
Agent Russell, here's the
information you requested.

01:10:59.428 --> 01:11:02.197
That's the FBI's list
for Energyne's servers.

01:11:02.199 --> 01:11:03.665
You were right.

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.666
There's one server that
they left off.

01:11:05.668 --> 01:11:07.771
And there's only two people
that have access to it.

01:11:09.739 --> 01:11:14.243
Brett and Claire,
you sneaky sons of bitches.

01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:16.013
- Thank you, son.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:19.882 --> 01:11:22.420
It's Russell. I need a ride.

01:11:24.422 --> 01:11:26.691
Come on, this way, this way!
Keep moving!

01:11:34.631 --> 01:11:36.700
- Where to?
- Eighty-fifth floor.

01:11:44.807 --> 01:11:45.943
Lab's in here.

01:11:46.776 --> 01:11:48.542
Damn it!

01:11:50.248 --> 01:11:51.880
Hey, give me some good news.

01:11:51.882 --> 01:11:54.250
MOABs are 30 minutes out,
give or take.

01:11:54.252 --> 01:11:56.385
<i>Just one could take out
five city blocks.</i>

01:11:56.387 --> 01:11:57.719
<i>You better move!</i>

01:11:57.721 --> 01:11:59.720
I'm never taking your
call again.

01:11:59.722 --> 01:12:02.090
It's locked. What'd he say?

01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:05.213
Uh, something about the mother of all
bombs is on its way and we need to hurry.

01:12:08.632 --> 01:12:09.900
Okay.

01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:14.169
Jeez!

01:12:14.171 --> 01:12:16.241
FBI must've confiscated
all the hard drives.

01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:18.907
All right.

01:12:18.909 --> 01:12:21.246
Come on, Kate, think.

01:12:22.445 --> 01:12:23.680
Here we go.

01:12:26.482 --> 01:12:30.452
Okay, everything in the lab
is on one system.

01:12:30.454 --> 01:12:33.688
The FBI would never have thought
to confiscate a thermostat,

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.523
but there's a backdoor into
the server.

01:12:35.525 --> 01:12:38.093
So we should be able to access
every file

01:12:38.095 --> 01:12:39.928
from here.

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:42.964
<i>Okay. Change of plan.
The military's lost control.</i>

01:12:42.966 --> 01:12:44.631
We're coming up.

01:12:44.633 --> 01:12:45.966
All right.

01:12:45.968 --> 01:12:48.469
The chopper is ready.

01:12:48.471 --> 01:12:51.473
I have got your rat.

01:12:51.475 --> 01:12:54.975
Let's get the R-19 from the
lab so we have some leverage

01:12:54.977 --> 01:12:57.647
when this shitstorm
finally catches up with us.

01:12:58.481 --> 01:12:59.980
Now what?

01:12:59.982 --> 01:13:01.151
We have visitors.

01:13:03.787 --> 01:13:06.019
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:07.855
The system has been
totally scrubbed.

01:13:07.857 --> 01:13:10.524
They erased everything
connected to the project.

01:13:10.526 --> 01:13:12.394
But it's here.

01:13:12.396 --> 01:13:14.165
We just have to find it.

01:13:14.998 --> 01:13:16.201
In there!

01:13:19.668 --> 01:13:20.970
I got this.

01:13:28.212 --> 01:13:29.512
I like it.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.813
What are we looking for?

01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:34.014
Anything that starts
with "RPG."

01:13:34.016 --> 01:13:36.151
It'll be in one of these
cryopreserve trays.

01:13:36.153 --> 01:13:37.585
Got it.

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:39.190
RPG, RPG.

01:13:41.658 --> 01:13:43.026
I think I found it.

01:13:52.769 --> 01:13:53.937
This is it.

01:13:55.437 --> 01:13:57.338
Is that the cure?

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.674
Not a cure exactly.

01:13:59.676 --> 01:14:03.010
R-19 doesn't revert them
to their normal size.

01:14:03.012 --> 01:14:05.181
It just overrides
their unchecked aggression.

01:14:08.118 --> 01:14:09.850
Nice to see you, Kate.

01:14:09.852 --> 01:14:11.454
Go to hell, Claire.

01:14:12.955 --> 01:14:16.227
I was so sorry
to hear about your brother.

01:14:24.034 --> 01:14:26.271
Now, why don't you hand
those over?

01:14:39.249 --> 01:14:41.582
All right, let's go.

01:14:41.584 --> 01:14:43.154
That's not happening.

01:14:45.388 --> 01:14:47.158
Can I see that, please?

01:14:54.797 --> 01:14:55.932
Davis.

01:14:59.402 --> 01:15:00.501
That happened.

01:15:00.503 --> 01:15:01.768
Davis.

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:03.139
Now, let's go.

01:15:04.975 --> 01:15:07.011
- Oh, my God!
- Now.

01:15:17.288 --> 01:15:18.655
They're here.

01:15:49.485 --> 01:15:50.486
Move!

01:15:53.155 --> 01:15:56.356
I was actually starting to worry about how
we were gonna reengineer the pathogen.

01:15:57.328 --> 01:15:59.160
Then you showed up.

01:15:59.162 --> 01:16:01.299
Now, get in unless you wanna
end up like your friend.

01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:21.584
Brett! Get back here!

01:16:32.061 --> 01:16:33.196
No!

01:16:42.038 --> 01:16:43.040
Come on.

01:16:51.881 --> 01:16:53.349
I thought you were dead!

01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:54.916
Well, I think she missed
all the vital organs,

01:16:54.918 --> 01:16:56.351
but don't jinx it.

01:16:56.353 --> 01:16:57.919
Now, let's get that
antidote. Come on!

01:16:57.921 --> 01:16:59.455
Davis, wait.

01:17:00.522 --> 01:17:01.958
I have one.

01:17:03.259 --> 01:17:05.193
Okay, new plan.

01:17:05.195 --> 01:17:06.560
We give it to George and maybe he
can help us stop the other two.

01:17:06.562 --> 01:17:07.698
Okay.

01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:15.742
Now, we just have to figure out how
the hell we're gonna give it to him.

01:17:17.574 --> 01:17:18.942
We gotta move!

01:17:25.316 --> 01:17:28.715
You know, I'm actually glad
you're both still alive.

01:17:28.717 --> 01:17:30.084
Now, you can go up there
and distract your friend

01:17:30.086 --> 01:17:31.588
while I get the hell
out of here!

01:17:33.391 --> 01:17:35.426
Or I could kill you both now!

01:17:41.897 --> 01:17:43.132
Okay.

01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:45.735
I'll go.

01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:50.807
George!

01:17:53.008 --> 01:17:55.943
Get away from me!
Get your hands off me!

01:17:55.945 --> 01:17:57.948
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:59.982 --> 01:18:01.784
Feeding the monster to
the gorilla!

01:18:11.694 --> 01:18:13.964
Oh, shit!

01:18:20.337 --> 01:18:21.602
What?

01:18:21.604 --> 01:18:23.804
No, forget my sister!

01:18:23.806 --> 01:18:25.605
She lost her goddamn mind!

01:18:25.607 --> 01:18:28.611
You just get an SUV over here!
You get me out of here now!

01:18:31.047 --> 01:18:32.349
Damn, son!

01:18:34.317 --> 01:18:37.684
Did you just run down
80 flights of stairs?

01:18:37.686 --> 01:18:39.719
Who the hell are you?

01:18:39.721 --> 01:18:42.291
I'm the fella that was gonna run
up those stairs to arrest you.

01:18:42.293 --> 01:18:43.858
But, shit,

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.563
you look so terrible
I feel kind of bad about it.

01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:52.201
I'll tell you what.

01:18:52.203 --> 01:18:55.336
Since you're working so hard
to get out of here,

01:18:55.338 --> 01:18:58.306
I'm guessing you got a laptop
in that bag there.

01:18:58.308 --> 01:19:00.974
You give it to me and you
can just get.

01:19:00.976 --> 01:19:03.010
Right out that door.

01:19:03.012 --> 01:19:05.413
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:05.415 --> 01:19:07.684
You just hand it over
and be on your way.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.886
Okay!

01:19:12.888 --> 01:19:14.921
It's really my sister
who did all this.

01:19:14.923 --> 01:19:16.424
This wasn't even my idea.

01:19:16.426 --> 01:19:18.559
Since when is
complicity a crime?

01:19:18.561 --> 01:19:20.362
Exactly.

01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:22.996
- See you, Tex!
- Hey!

01:19:22.998 --> 01:19:24.959
Why don't you leave the
little fella here with me?

01:19:26.735 --> 01:19:29.406
That's my pleasure.
I hate that thing!

01:19:39.548 --> 01:19:40.747
Oh.

01:19:40.749 --> 01:19:42.450
Damn.

01:19:42.452 --> 01:19:43.954
That was a lot.

01:19:47.891 --> 01:19:50.191
Boy, I hope y'all have
a plan up there.

01:19:50.193 --> 01:19:53.597
What do you say, little fella?
Let's you and I take another exit.

01:20:13.982 --> 01:20:16.417
When does the antidote
kick in?

01:20:16.419 --> 01:20:18.719
Ten minutes, maybe.

01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:20.891
This building is not gonna
be standing in 10 minutes!

01:20:28.463 --> 01:20:30.235
How the hell do we get
off this roof?

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:36.469
Maybe we don't have
to get off the roof at all.

01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:37.473
What?

01:20:41.744 --> 01:20:44.178
No, we definitely do!

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.316
Come on, come on!

01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:49.483
Davis!

01:20:49.485 --> 01:20:51.319
There's no tail on this
helicopter!

01:20:51.321 --> 01:20:52.586
That's right. We don't
need one.

01:20:52.588 --> 01:20:54.087
You do, if you wanna fly!

01:20:54.089 --> 01:20:56.257
We're not gonna fly,
we're gonna crash.

01:20:56.259 --> 01:20:57.294
What?

01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:03.630
Okay...

01:21:03.632 --> 01:21:05.765
We just need to get enough lift to stay
on top of the building as it falls.

01:21:05.767 --> 01:21:07.436
You know,
just like riding an avalanche.

01:21:08.338 --> 01:21:09.705
No, I don't know!

01:21:19.383 --> 01:21:21.118
Come on, baby!
Here we go.

01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:39.400
Oh, my God!

01:21:39.402 --> 01:21:40.736
This could get ugly.

01:21:46.575 --> 01:21:48.643
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:21:48.645 --> 01:21:49.646
Oh, Jesus!

01:21:52.348 --> 01:21:54.551
Oh, my God!

01:22:01.658 --> 01:22:03.660
Hold on, Kate!

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.169
Brace!

01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:02.252
I got you.

01:23:13.829 --> 01:23:15.333
I need a drink.

01:23:27.343 --> 01:23:29.346
I can't believe we
survived that.

01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:34.682
Wait, there's still
people here.

01:23:34.684 --> 01:23:36.820
We need to call off the airstrike.
Come on.

01:23:51.368 --> 01:23:52.636
Davis.

01:23:54.204 --> 01:23:55.504
I know.

01:24:02.212 --> 01:24:03.347
George?

01:24:05.681 --> 01:24:06.883
You okay?

01:24:19.228 --> 01:24:20.463
Thank God.

01:24:21.963 --> 01:24:23.833
Good to have you back, buddy.

01:24:28.738 --> 01:24:30.374
Oh, I look like shit?

01:24:31.007 --> 01:24:32.373
<i>Okay.</i>

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:35.678
You look like big shit!

01:24:54.663 --> 01:24:55.898
Come on.

01:25:00.869 --> 01:25:03.069
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

01:25:03.071 --> 01:25:04.904
<i>Escorts are in position. We are
eight minutes from target.</i>

01:25:04.906 --> 01:25:06.706
<i>Over.</i>

01:25:06.708 --> 01:25:08.210
<i>Roger, Two-Five.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

01:25:08.212 --> 01:25:09.713
<i>- Over.
- Copy that.</i>

01:25:11.513 --> 01:25:13.115
Let's go! Let's go!

01:25:15.117 --> 01:25:16.783
What's the plan?

01:25:16.785 --> 01:25:19.118
I want you to take this Humvee
and find a sat phone.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.889
And get a hold of Russell. He's our only
shot at calling off this airstrike.

01:25:21.891 --> 01:25:24.791
Then let him know there's still military
personnel and civilians on the ground.

01:25:24.793 --> 01:25:26.293
George and I will handle
the other two.

01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:28.062
- Davis?
- Yeah?

01:25:28.064 --> 01:25:30.401
Try not to get killed, okay?

01:25:31.368 --> 01:25:32.636
Come on, get going.

01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:45.612
All right, George. We gotta stop these
things before they destroy the city.

01:25:47.482 --> 01:25:50.153
That's right.
Let's kick some ass.

01:26:08.671 --> 01:26:09.972
Oh, shit!

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:34.497
Of course the wolf flies.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.980
Hey!
Come and get me,

01:26:53.982 --> 01:26:55.985
you ugly son of a bitch!

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:04.628
That's it!

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:28.916
Help! I need a satellite
phone!

01:27:28.918 --> 01:27:30.584
It's not safe here, ma'am.
We need to go now.

01:27:30.586 --> 01:27:31.852
You two, get her on the truck.

01:27:31.854 --> 01:27:34.654
Wait! There's a way to
stop this!

01:27:34.656 --> 01:27:35.822
Fellas.

01:27:35.824 --> 01:27:37.157
Russell?

01:27:37.159 --> 01:27:39.559
- I will take it from here.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:41.395
Take a breath, Doc.

01:27:41.397 --> 01:27:42.763
Tell me what you're
doing here.

01:27:42.765 --> 01:27:44.531
The antidote worked.

01:27:44.533 --> 01:27:46.400
Davis and George are trying
to stop the other two.

01:27:46.402 --> 01:27:48.702
But there's still civilians
and military on the ground.

01:27:48.704 --> 01:27:51.074
We have to call off the
airstrike.

01:27:54.443 --> 01:27:57.678
Son, I'll tell you what.
Let's trade.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.548
- All right, come on. Let's get.
- Hey. Hey!

01:28:07.056 --> 01:28:08.725
George, go!

01:29:25.467 --> 01:29:28.203
Colonel Blake, it is your
old pal, Agent Russell.

01:29:28.205 --> 01:29:29.803
Listen, about your MOABs.

01:29:29.805 --> 01:29:31.839
Do me a favor, would you,

01:29:31.841 --> 01:29:34.974
<i>and take a gander at Federal
Plaza before you drop them?</i>

01:29:34.976 --> 01:29:37.111
Bring up the drone feed
on Federal Plaza.

01:29:37.113 --> 01:29:38.214
Yes, sir.

01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:43.520
My God.

01:30:41.177 --> 01:30:42.545
Oh, come on.

01:30:59.361 --> 01:31:01.264
George, no!

01:31:04.132 --> 01:31:06.599
<i>This is Viper Two-Five.
Two minutes out.</i>

01:31:06.601 --> 01:31:09.736
<i>Target is locked.
MOABs are armed.</i>

01:31:09.738 --> 01:31:11.106
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

01:31:24.919 --> 01:31:26.586
Run!

01:31:26.588 --> 01:31:28.658
Get up! You gotta move!

01:31:56.118 --> 01:31:57.951
Come on, come on, come on!

01:31:57.953 --> 01:31:59.356
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

01:32:26.316 --> 01:32:28.356
You mess with my friend,
you mess with me, mother...

01:32:43.365 --> 01:32:44.368
Shit!

01:33:56.739 --> 01:33:57.874
George.

01:34:01.311 --> 01:34:02.445
George.

01:34:07.449 --> 01:34:09.219
I'll be damned.

01:34:10.953 --> 01:34:12.255
Abort mission.

01:34:45.654 --> 01:34:46.989
George.

01:34:48.022 --> 01:34:49.426
Hey, buddy.

01:34:58.434 --> 01:34:59.534
We did it.

01:35:02.538 --> 01:35:04.107
We saved the city.

01:35:10.111 --> 01:35:11.214
Yeah.

01:35:12.013 --> 01:35:13.615
You saved me.

01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:17.019
George saved Davis.

01:35:51.387 --> 01:35:52.522
George.

01:35:54.356 --> 01:35:55.490
George!

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.942
I'm so sorry, Davis.

01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:51.278
He saved my life.

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.282
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

01:37:21.577 --> 01:37:22.578
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:37:34.489 --> 01:37:35.825
Yes, he did.

01:37:46.034 --> 01:37:47.470
Did I just see you close
your eye?

01:37:49.338 --> 01:37:51.172
I just saw you open your eye!

01:37:57.213 --> 01:37:59.380
Son of a bitch!

01:37:59.382 --> 01:38:00.947
Pretending to be dead?

01:38:00.949 --> 01:38:03.287
- At a time like this?
- Oh, my God!

01:38:09.156 --> 01:38:10.523
No, no.

01:38:10.525 --> 01:38:12.524
No, it's not funny
and I wasn't crying!

01:38:12.526 --> 01:38:14.893
I wasn't crying, okay? There's
a lot of debris around here!

01:38:14.895 --> 01:38:16.795
Wait, is this like a thing
between you guys?

01:38:16.797 --> 01:38:18.999
This is not a thing between us.
It's a thing with him!

01:38:19.001 --> 01:38:21.503
Because he has a twisted
sense of humor!

01:38:25.407 --> 01:38:29.210
Yes, I guess you could
say that.

01:38:29.212 --> 01:38:31.844
She is part of my troop.

01:38:31.846 --> 01:38:33.679
I mean, we're friends, right?

01:38:33.681 --> 01:38:35.416
Yeah.

01:38:35.418 --> 01:38:37.321
Yes, we're friends.

01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:42.822
No! Come on, dude!

01:38:42.824 --> 01:38:44.657
Have some class, okay?

01:38:44.659 --> 01:38:47.193
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Kate, I'm so sorry.

01:38:47.195 --> 01:38:48.661
George, stop.

01:38:48.663 --> 01:38:50.095
All right, all right, guys.

01:38:50.097 --> 01:38:51.997
Let's go home, okay?

01:38:51.999 --> 01:38:53.433
Dude, that was funny.

01:38:53.435 --> 01:38:54.733
I heard that!

01:38:54.735 --> 01:38:56.603
Shit.

01:38:56.605 --> 01:38:59.738
Thank you for saving the
world.

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.608
Yeah, thanks for calling off
the airstrike.

01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:03.910
Like a wise cowboy
once said,

01:39:03.912 --> 01:39:07.179
us assholes gotta
stick together.

01:39:07.181 --> 01:39:09.216
How about we all help
these people out,

01:39:09.218 --> 01:39:11.351
and then find George
here a new home.

01:39:11.353 --> 01:39:13.886
Where are we gonna put him?

01:39:13.888 --> 01:39:16.956
I can tell you right now, we're
not gonna put him on a plane.
